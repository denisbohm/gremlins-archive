<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Let's start with your background.<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Basically I don't have any formal training in what I do
other than a few courses in scene design that I took in
college. Everything I've learned how to do has been pretty
much on the job, by getting myself in a position that was a
little bit beyond me and then just strugglinq to catch up.
For the first couple years after I got out of college I was
doing theatre work, prop work, for a children' s theatre
company. I made big strange things like Alice in Wonderland
puppets, and things like that. In materials I was working
in styrofoam and rubber, yarn and garbage, anything I could
get my hands on. I just specialized in that and I went from
there, to the point where I started to do this freelance.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Is this how you were making your living at the time?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, I had a period where I worked part time working with
the developmentally disabled, and I did that for five years, but other
than that it's always been artwork one way or another.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
When were you born?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
1955.  I'm 37.
<p>

<img src="squash.jpg" width="98" height="216" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">
<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
What state were you born in?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
I was born right in this area (Albany, NY). I've lived here
all my life. Born in Troy, grew up in Latham, moved to
Albany, so I've been all over the place. After doing the
prop work for a while, I started to lose my interest in the
theatre: I guess part of it was just the difficulty of it.
There can be
an awful lot of killer deadlines and
very little money and so on and so forth. And eventually, I
began to feel that the things I was making were good enough
to stand on their own. I've done stints of things like
working for the New York State Museum, I spent seven months
making squash plants. There's a number of nightclubs in
the area that have my artwork on display.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Such as what sort of things?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Oh, scary stuff, like vampires, and vampire bats and just a
pool of blood with hands and skulls coming out of it, that's
on the ceiling of this nightclub called QE2. Machine parts
sculptures.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Great! I love that kind of stuff, I've done quite a few
nightclub installations myself.<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Oh, it's great work when you can get it! But it's like,
again, the money always sucks and they always want more than
they're ready to pay for. But the nice thing about it is
that if you happen to go into the nightclub to hang out and
somebody will be standing next to you with no idea that
you're the person who made that thing they're staring at.
And you get to hear all of these unsolicited comments. A
lot of which are &quot;God! What sort of sick mother made that
thing?&quot;
<p>
<img src="fantasy.jpg" width="233" height="216" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">
Eventually I started to focus specifically on that sort of
thing, to try to be a sculptor. What I was trying to do
were these very elaborate fantasy candles and trying to sell
them in craft shows. I started calling myself
&quot;<a href="../jeff_brower/index.html">Mystic Visions</a>,&quot;
as a DBA (&quot;doing business as&quot;) and I've been sort
of stuck with that name ever since. And that became the
longest job I've ever had, that's still what I'm doing,
carrying on from that point. And it was during this period
where I taught myself how to cast in wax, and that's more or
less what got me going with Screamin'.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Explain a little bit about how you first heard about
Screamin'?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
There was a guy out on the West Coast doing special effects
for movies named Bruce Fuller and he was one of these people
that I'd heard about. He lived here in Schenectady and he
did prop work for some of the local theatre Companies. He
did the same sorts of things that I was doing but I had
never met him; and it was one of these deals where people
kept saying to me, &quot;You should meet this guy!&quot; Finally, we
ended up at the same horror convention here in Albany and
were introduced to each other. And very shortly thereafter
he got his big break and went out to California to work on
Dick Tracy. And right before he left he had some projects
that he was already in the middle of. He hired me to finish
those projects for him. Somewhere in that process he passed
my name on to Daniel Fay of Screamin'.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Can you mention which projects those were?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
They weren't film projects or anything. He was doing toy
prototypes. He was sculpting like a bulldog, that was
supposed to stick onto the bumper of someone's car, as if
your car's been bit by a bulldog. This was like five years
ago or something like that. They were car novelties,
essentially. So he hired me to finish the sculptures and do
the molds; and he took off to California.
<p>
At that point I guess he might have sculpted something for
Screamin. I don't know that for absolute fact but I think
he either sculpted or re-sculpted Jason for them and was
doing some molding. So a that point, I believe the
reference could have gotten passed on to Daniel. Now we've
had a long, like four-year relationship, I would say. I'd
do mold work as they needed it and other sort of touch-up
jobs.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Could you mention which kits those were?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Oh boy!
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
To the best of your memory?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
I did moldwork for Leatherface, Pinhead, the Mutants, the
Vampyre, the Werewolf: of course I also sculpted the Female
Cenobite, Betty Page (I did not mold Betty Page, though). I
sculpted and molded Butterball. I molded Yoda and the Red
Dragon. I did some resculpting work on Darth Vader, also
molded it, and on the Rocketeer I just cast the waxes -- I
didn't mold that. I had something to do with almost all of
them except a few, starting with the Werewolf. A good
portion of what's in their catalog now. Nothing to do with
the Chatterer at all. I didn't have too much to do with the
Rocketeer. I had nothing to do with Elvira or Freddy, but
just about everybody else.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Okay, how did you segue from a moldmaker into a sculptor?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Well, Daniel and I obviously developed a good working
relationship over a period of time and almost every
sculpture would require some sort of revision and
correction. So we began to get some sort of idea of what
could do through my doing those revisions and anytime
would be finishing a project for somebody else I made sure
that Daniel got a look at it. But for a long time he just
did not want to hire me as a sculptor. I mean, I had not
done any likenesses of any kind. I hadn't proved that I
could sculpt a likeness of anything.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Those other Projects that you showed him, were they props or
masks or...?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Monster masks and props and things like that. Then
eventually, I got to the point where I could do a few garage
kit figurines. I did a limited edition of Betty Page for
Screamin'. I wasn't terribly happy with it. And I never
felt I got the likeness quite right. It's still a nice
sculpture, but I don't know if it looks all that much like
Betty Page.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Did you silicone mold it?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
No, though my dad works for a silicone factory. And I
started molding things out of silicone quite a few years
ago, mainly for my own purposes at first. And then
eventually Bruce Fuller of course recommended me to Daniel.
But they got other manufactures to do that for me (mold
work.) They went through two: they had some problems but I
didn't have to do it this time. Everybody bought them and
they sold out the whole edition of 1500. And then from
Betty we went on to Butterball and the Female Cenobite,
Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker. And now I'm doing Han Solo,
and that brings us up to date on that.
<p>

<img src="butterball.jpg" width="107" height="216" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">
<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Okay, could you go into the Butterball first, and tell us
the whole process. from the day you got the go-ahead and
signed your contract, to reference and how you approached
it. Just a basic overview. Did you use Sculpey or resin
Putty? What kind of armature?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Basically it was a joint contract for the two figures, so I
got all the reference materials together for the two of
them. I had some fairly good pictures for Butterball. I
had some pictures of the actor, Simon Bamford, in his
costume without the makeup on. They were really helpful in
terms of figuring out what the torture tools in his apron
were.
<p>
Daniel had decided what he wanted in terms of a pose. He
said, &quot;I want to have them see into his belly.&quot; Fingers in
the gash, so that's pretty much what I did. I started doing
the figure. I tried to put myself into the mind of the
figure, get in front of the mirror and take the pose myself.
When I did that, I sort of did this &quot;flasher&quot; type of
feeling. That's essentially what I tried to do, jut out the
head a little bit, roll the shoulders down, to set sort of a
vaguely obscene feel without getting to the point where they
wouldn't be able to sell the product. Daniel and I talked
about that. &quot;If you do that, it's got to be subtle.&quot;
That's kind of why he's got his belly stuck out like that.
As far as the armature and the sculpture, there wasn't much
to it. I do use Sculpey, sometimes I use Super-Sculpey -
although it's definitely harder. you lose one of the major
advantages to Sculpey. which is that Super-Sculpey shrinks,
so it will crack on an armature, whereas the original
Sculpey doesn't.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
You mean the original polyform formula, the white stuff?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, the white stuff definitely shrinks less than Super-Sculpey,
plus it's half the price.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Yeah, and you had to build up a large block of it for
Butterball!<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Well. I needed to make like chunks of aluminum foil, for
Butterball, basically. In terms of the overall look, he's
just a big, blocky thing! There were essentially two big
blocks of aluminum foil on top of each other with a layer of
Sculpey in between them. And I didn't separate it until it
was all done and baked.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
No armature wire or anything?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Nope!
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Just aluminum foil?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
That has it's pros and cons. You can get bubbles trapped in
the aluminum foil, that want to work their way out, but it
makes for very lightweight and economical sculptures.
Because you can build up enormous masses and then just have
a thin layer of Sculpey material.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
And it doesn't crack or break when you're sawing through it
or anything?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Well, I didn't have to saw through the aluminum foil; it's
just two pieces. No, it doesn't seem to create any
additional problems. I suppose it could if you have thin
enough places flaking off the aluminum foil when you cut
through it.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Was the reference provided by Image Animation and Bob Keen?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, it was. There were some pictures which were sent from
Image Animation. For Butterball, it wasn't too bad. It
wasn't very extensive for any of the characters, I must say.
For the female, my reference was awful. They sent a number
of fairly nice pictures of Barbie Wilde, who was not the one
I was doing. I mean, the only pictures I had of the Female
Cenobite, was the little tiny one in the beginning of The
Hellraiser Chronicles, and one group shot that Steve
Goodrich provided (all four of them with Clive Barker in
front of them). Essentially most of the reference came from
just sitting in front of the movies with the remote, and
freeze-framing over and over again.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Continue about your techniques. How did you approach the
sculpting?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
I can tell you about some conversations as things transpired
on the two different figures. With Butterball, Daniel's
main concerns were: first, he's pretty good at giving me a
lot of leeway. He's come to trust me over time. We do
sometimes disagree and we will argue over whether this or
that is right, but it tends to be civil and if either one of
us feels strongly, the other one will usually give in. so
it's a pretty good working relationship
<p>
Two of the major things he said to me was when I was working
on Butterball was that he wanted the wound to be difficult
to look at. That's an exact quote; he said, &quot;I want this to
be difficult to look at.&quot; I did my best to do that! And
the other thing was, he wanted grommets and laces as good
as the ones Randy Bowen did on the Rocketeer. So I put a
lot of effort into that.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
How about some basics on the sculptural techniques: do you
make your own tools? Do you use store bought-tools? Do you
use your fingers?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
I don't think there's any better tool to use than your
fingers. I use a mixture of a few wooden tools that I have
become very fond of, that are almost an extension of my hand
because I've used them for so long. I also use a variety of
found objects. Like knitting needles, cuticle tools. I use
alcohol to thin out the tool marks. It tends to be an
ongoing thing to sculpt with brushes. It doesn't make it
very mushy for long; alcohol evaporates quickly. If you
bake it too soon after you do that, you get bubbles and
cracks. I let it dry out before I bake it. It's best to
let it sit for a few days after the last time I douse it
with alcohol.
<p>
I don't have any specialized tools for making grommets and
laces. For the most part I just don't feel that there is
much of a substitute for a good eye and a good hand. If you
have that you can pretty much just do what you need to do
without gimmicks. In fact, we have these elaborate
conversations between Daniel and I about how I want to do
the grommets. He made a point of saying, &quot;I don't want you
to roll out little snakes and put them on. That's not what
I want. They never come out evenly and they never look
right. I want you to either use some sort of injection
technique or use wires.&quot; I experimented with that and did
like he asked me to do. Eventually I wound up rolling out
little snakes and just putting them on, like he asked me not
to do! There was a very specific reason why I did that. It
was the only way I could get the tension and the distortions
in the leather that a lace makes. If you just put two
snakes over each other, or two wires over each other, it's
just not that simple. You have to sculpt in the tension.
<p>
So ultimately, that seemed to be the way to do it. It came
out just fine. With Butterball, there was not a lot of
specifics. With both of these characters, to tell the
honest-to-god truth  Dan was very enthusiastic about Pinhead
and the Chatterer but he didn't really have that much
interest in the remaining characters.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
So the rest of the characters were basically just to
complete the set?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes. We got a lot of requests for other Cenobites so we
went ahead and did Butterball, and next the Female Cenobite.
<p>

<img src="female_cenobite.jpg" width="61" height="144" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">
<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Let's talk a little bit about the Female Cenobite.<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Actually, the female had almost no armature. That's because
of the big v-shape in her middle. I just didn't want to try
to saw through anything at the point of that V. So what I
did was take two pieces of curtain rod, and installed one
piece inside the other. But, I'll tell you that it was
almost an unbelievable disaster: because there wasn't enough
support. I had never tried this before and I thought that a
good solid block of Sculpey all the way through ought to be
good. But it softened in the baking process and started
sagging. I had major distortions and major cracks when I
took it out of the oven. I didn't carve it out of a block,
but there was almost no armature. I managed to repair it,
obviously. But if it had been much worse, it would have
been practically unrepairable. It was so bad, it took a
good solid day of work to repair it. It had tons of
airbubbles. I had to grind it, dremel it, carve it, re-bend
it and rebuild it. I had to putty it up, glue it back
together, fill in cracks, all this sort of stuff, and
duplicate textures.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Do you use texture pads for your leather texture?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
No, I use whatever is at hand. Sometimes I just sculpt it
in. I use the technique where you put cellophane on the
clay and sculpt through it.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
How many pieces did you saw her up into?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
The female is three pieces: the skirt, the torso, the upper
arm. I also did the molding on the kit. We kind of went
back and forth over whether or not she should be sexy. I
wanted her to be sexy.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Meaning more hips, more accentuation on the curves,
cleavage, etc.?<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yeah, less of that &quot;pregnant belly&quot; look: a sexy pose, give
her some cleavage, things like that. There was something
seductive about this character. So the way you see the
final sculpture is a compromise. It's a little sexier than
Screamin' would have liked it and a little less sexy than I
would have made it. But, I'm very pleased now, maybe I was
wrong. It's better this way, she looks more like a Cenobite
than if I would have given her more of a figure. Other than
that, I had free reign. I was the one that suggested the
pose. I did the sculpture, the molds. I painted the one
that's on the cover of the box. It was my suggestion as to
what the cover of the box should look like.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Well, I think it looks great. I especially like the box on
her back detail. You took a little artistic license with
it, especially since you had no definitive reference on what
her back really looked like. I look forward to seeing other
examples of your sculpting for Screamin' in the future.
Good luck and thank you.<br>

<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
You're welcome.
