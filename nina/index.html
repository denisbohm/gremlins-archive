Another lost soul! Don't do it! I beg you! Just say no.
Sure, first it's just the wire armatures - but that leads to the hard
stuff, Super Sculpy. It's insideous! Your day job suffers.
Your wife gets neglected. The kids are
running around like wild monkeys. You're up all hours looking only for that
next wif of baked Sculpy. Then it gets REALLLLY bad. Resin! From there,
you're in sculpting hell with no chance of redemption. Madness is all you
will know. My advice is to run. Run fast. Run far. Run for your life.

<h2>The Fever</h2>
How can you be around garage kits and not catch the fever!  You can't!
And what's the next step when some resin heads get to shooting the
breeze?  Produce a kit!  That's just what happened...

<h2>The Concept</h2>
<img src=gremlin1.gif width=209 height=216 align=right>
Since we meet through Gremlins in the Garage, it was a natural to do
some kind of gremlin kit first.  The first idea was to do a gremlin
standing at a table sculpting all the elements that can be found in
the GitG navigation bar.  Spice it up by having the gremlin croutching
on the bench and it would make a neat kit.  Of course, then someone
has a blast of inspiration - Nina Gremlin Skin!  Thanks, Leann!  Now
we have some great elements: beautiful woman, gremlins, water.  What
more could anyone ask for!

<h2>The Pose</h2>
<img src=pose1.jpg width=174 height=216 align=right>
Nina wearing a gremlin suit.
Her arms straight out to the sides and her head arched back.
Ankle to knee deep in boiling frothing water.
The water is contained inside a fountain carved out of stone
with gargoyle faces, etc.
New born gremlin pods are popping out of her skin.
Lights will be riged up in the "water" to produce a
weird flashing effect in the water of the gremlins reproducing.
A couple partially formed gremlins stretching to escape their pods.
A couple fully formed gremlins grining at Nina.
An expression that is a mixture of pain and pleasure as she's
birthing the little fellas.
Sorry, I've gotta go hose myself down!

<h2>The Rules</h2>
Before we go any further, what are the rules of this collaborative
game?
Keep good notes, take lots of progress pics, we're going to want to
write this project up as an article for gremlins.

<h2>The Date</h2>
If we work slowly and steadily on the project, we should be able to
have something done by next March.  It'd be a blast to be able to
present copies of the kit to Nirasawa and Chris Walas! Let's avoid
a last minute crunch.

<h2>The Plan</h2>
<ol>

<li>
Come up with a cool pose that we all like.

<li>
Sculpt a nude (oh, my) woman in the pose.
She need not be too detailed.
Most of the body will have a scaly suit sculpted over it.
Do we want part of her breasts exposed?  Maybe just the
edges of the nipples?
Traditionally, Nina <b>is</b> clothed, albeit scantily.
Her face, throat, and upper torso should be fairly detailed.
1:6 scale.

<li>
Cast a couple of copies to work on.

<li>
Add the gremlin suit and Nina's artifical arm.

<li> 
Create the base.
We should bring some other people in on this -
specifically to work on sculpting the little gremlins.

<li> 
Make molds and cast a couple of prototypes.

<li> 
Paint a prototype.

</ol>
