<H2>Open Judging System Released!</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>We are pleased to announce the first project completed under the Model Enthusiast Society banner! An open judging system designed to be fair and educational to model show participants, yet still be easy to use for the show staff.</P>
<P>The system has been in development for over a half a year now and is the brain child of MiA member Bob Hise. After plenty of revisions and input from members Scott Longberry and Tom Grossman, the current system has been acheived. It has been tested on a variety of kit types together (when was the last time you saw aircraft, armor, and figure kits judged side by side? Well, we can do it!) and still provides consistent and fair results.</P>
<P>"Enough of the hype already! How do I get my hands on the system?", you ask. Easy. The <A HREF="Judge_Card_Combined.pdf">judging cards</A>, along with the instructions for using the system, are available in PDF format (if you don't have the free Adobe Acrobat plug in, <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com">go get it</A>). They are formatted to be printed two cards to an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper with the judging section on the front and the criteria and definitions on the back. Print them out, cut them in half, and you're ready to judge your show. All we ask is that you not modify the system without permission and that you give credit where credit is due. It's as simple as that!</P>
