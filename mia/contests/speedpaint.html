   All tools and paints will be provided for you.
  <LI> 
   There is a limited amount of paint available, you will be given palettes to work from.

   If a color you want is not available, mix it yourself. You do remember your color wheel from art class, don't you? 
  <LI>
   You have 30 minutes to paint your miniature the best paint job you can.
  <LI>
   When time is called, hands up. You're done.
  <LI>
   Participants and staff will then vote on the best paint job. Please do not vote for yourself.

   While the votes are tallied, please clean up your own mess. Your mother is not a member of the staff. :)

   <LI>
    Members of the MIA club may not participate. You're supposed to be staffing the contest... remember... :)
