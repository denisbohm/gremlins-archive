<b>Bernie Wrightson</b> has been working as a professional illustrator for nearly thirty
years, beginning as an editorial cartoonist for the Baltimore Sun. Since then his work
has appeared in books, magazines, and motion pictures.  He is the co-creator of the comic book
character <b>Swamp Thing</b>, and has illustrated several works by <b>Stephen King</b>, including <b>The
Stand</b>, <b>Creepshow</b> and <b>The Cycle of the Werewolf</b>. He has also designed creatures for
several movies, most notably <b>Ghostbusters</b> and <b>Ghostbusters II</b>. But Wrightson may be best
know for his opus, the <b>Frankenstein</b> illustrations, universally regarded as the most compelling
visualization of the Mary Shelly novel.
