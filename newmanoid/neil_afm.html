Mark Newman is a name that many
long-time collector's will recognize
for quality sculptures in the past, but
Mark hasn't been very visible for the
last few years.  With the release of
The Neanderthal, let's hope that Mark
plans to be around a long, long time!
This is a fantastic kit!  I'm glad to
see original designs becoming more
frequent, and Mr. Newman's
Neanderthal is one of the best I've
seen.  The pose and body language
are dynamic, the figure looks as
though he could leap off the base
and on to your head in a split second!
The Neanderthal is loaded with
wonderful, minute detail to the surfaces.
Take one look at the expression
in the creature's face and you
know you're dealing with a kits that's
bound to become a classic! The kit
goes together with no difficulty
whatsoever, the cuts between the
parts are so clean they look like hairline
cracks.  You don't have to club
me over the head to convince me to
buy one! DF (David Fisher)

After what has seemed like an
eternity, sculptor Mark Newman has
finally released his third kit.  This
time out, the San Francisco artist
has evoked an original design that is
nothing short of a resin masterpiece.
It excels not only in it's simplistic
assembly, but also with razor sharp
castings, a powerful pose, and
exquisitely sculpted details so lifelike
it's scary!  Highly recommended for
one and all. TW (Terry Webb)
