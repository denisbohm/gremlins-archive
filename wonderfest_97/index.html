'97 Spring show season got off to a rollicking start with
Wonderfest!  Those skeptics who thought this year's show would flop w/out a
big name like Ray Harryhausen, were soundly thumped by the packed dealer
room, heavy attendance, and record-setting number of quality contest
entries.  Here are just a few of the show highlights for those who couldn't
make it, or for those who just want to remember the fun we had!

<p>
First, let me say what a trip it was meeting so many grems at the show.
It's always great seeing gremlins at the shows, but this was the biggest
batch yet!  There's a real sense of belongingness whenever gremlins get
together.  If you haven't been a part of this at one of the big figure kit
shows, I HIGHLY recommend that you try to attend one!  The kits are great,
the friends are better!  With that said, let's get to the meat of things.
What's new in '97?
<p>
Maybe I'm getting jaded, but it seems to me that the hobby's getting
just a little glutted these days.  Lots of companies are cranking out the
kits for your money, but the number of exceptional sculptures and bargains
is still fairly modest IMHO.  I really got a sense of this while cruising
around the dealer room.  So many new releases, but only a few real gems.
Here are some of the new releases that made an impact on me, in no
particular order.
<p>
Greyzone has become a true fixture in the industry.  It's a table you
EXPECT to see at all of the big shows.  Likewise, you EXPECT to see at
least one or two cool new skulls that Luis has unearthed for our pleasure.
Well, I'm sad to say...  Just kidding!  Luis is back for '97 with a
vengeance and two new skulls: a Klingon and a GREMLIN!   Luis once again
unleashed his imagination and came up w/ a gorgeous interpretation of a
Klingon's brainbox.  Gremlin fans will be delighted with his 1:1 rendition
of the Gremlin skull as well.  (I can already see Denis getting out his
checkbook!)

<p>
Wondering what Matt McWhirt's been up to?  Matt's decided to close the
doors for good at &quot;Shape of Things,&quot; and is embarking on a new venture
called &quot;Windshear.&quot;  Windshear continues Matt's tradition of excellent
castings with kits from his new comic &quot;The XBI&quot; (Extraterrestrial Bureau of
Investigation.)  Matt was showing off a kit of his alien character Vox
Rylock, as well as a cool XBI-ified Nestor the Wonderfestor.  For those who
prefer their resin delights in a more realistic vein, look no further than
Robyn Hood, a gorgeous 1:6 rendition of Sherwood's feminine righter of
wrongs.  Also on display at the Windshear table was a way cool ID4-based
hive queen.
<p>
Matt was in good company with Steve and Melinda of Cellar Cast right
next door.  Last year's Demoness kit was available along with the Boris
kits.  Oh, did I mention that Steve's finished Vampire's Kiss?  YOW!  Quite
possibly the bargain of the show IMO.  If you thought the first two Boris
kits were nice, you ain't seen nuthin' yet.  As if the composition and
sculpting aren't great enough, terrific parting enables sectional painting,
and the seamlines are nearly invisible.  This will be one of the hottest
tickets of the '97.

<p>
Nightlife was showing off some great new items including their ever
expanding selection of blanks.  (I'm delighted to see different scales
being offered, but how's about some realistic proportioning on the female
blanks guys...)  Bladerunner fans would be pleased with the new Deckard kit
being offered.  The likeness to Harrison Ford was quite nice, and the pose
is solid.  Pair it up w/ that new Priss kit, and you'll be on your way!
<p>
Jimmy Flintstone has made giant strides in the past year since I last
saw his stuff.  Several of the new Testor's kits (i.e. King Thutmose) were
being shown, and I was REALLY impressed by how much his casting quality has
improved.  Jimmy's always offered neat sculptures at a fair price, but the
casting quality left a bit to be desired.  He's now using a different
resin, and is apparently taking greater pains to align molds and cast under
pressure.  The results are really terrific.  If Testor's distributes these
new kits properly, we may be seeing the figure kit hobby getting some
really favorable exposure.
<p>
The Diceman!  Our own Ed Bowkley made the trek from the coast to share
his wares with us 'po midwestern modelers.  Ed's really found his nitch in
60's television characters, and is plumbing the depths.  His John Astin,
Gomez kit was the real standout here with a clever pose and a great
likeness.  Herman Munster, Maxwell Smart, and a cool Don Knotts Barney kit
were on hand as well.

<p>
Just in case you didn't get enough East Coast hospitality from Ed, you
could swing right next door and pay Al Reboiro of Python Press a call!  Al
was showing off his new Connery James Bond kit based on artwork from
Thunderball.  It's really a distinctive pose, and Bond fans will want to
give it serious consideration.  Al's other pieces, like the Bowery Boys and
a new Munsters &quot;Spot&quot; were up for grabs as well.
<p>
Janus was back again this year, with their traditional kit debut.  This
time out is Thomas Kuntz's beautiful White Zombie kit featuring Bela
Lugosi.  No one seems to capture Lugosi like Kuntz, and with the imminent
(finally!) release of his Dracula sculpture from Dark Horse, Lugosi fans
have TWO reasons to rejoice!  Janus continued another tradition by offering
teasers of their upcoming releases.  Next year, expect to see Chris Walas'
Hideous Sun Demon diorama.  Janus continues to display a sculpture of
Karloff as the mummy, complete with sarcophogus, but there's no release
date in sight.  Some VERY preliminary sculpting on the Phantom kit was
shown, but that was about it.

Shawn Nagle and Eric Ko were showcasing all of the great Polydata Star
Wars figures.  These are great pieces to pop together and display, but
they're also great sculptures for those who want to take a swag at
repainting them.  Shawn was also showing off some fantastic new pieces
including a female kit (still in progress I believe), a hellhound, and an
awesome Godzillasaurus.
<p>
In case you couldn't get enough of Shawn's work at his own table, you
could always pop over to MiM's booth for a look at his new Harryhausen
Sabretooth or an intense kit of Blizzard from the Primal Rage video game.
MiM's still working the Harryhausen licenses pretty hard, but they were
also showing off their Nemo's Daughter and Barb Wire kits too.
<p>
Directly opposite MiM's table was Paul at the Character Shop!  Paul
seemed to have a fun time meeting many of the gremlins that showed up, and
offered a hospitality suite on Friday night to present some new kits he's
dealing from the UK: the infamous &quot;Norris You're Flippin' Kidding,&quot; a
hyper-detailed Raptor trophy mount, and one of the best likenesses I've
ever seen of Jack Nicholson - in 1:1 scale no less!
<p>
Terry Webb and David Fisher were on-hand from AFM to glad-hand w/ the
masses, and David was doing double-duty by debuting his brand new
ModelMania video.  For those who passed up the first two videos because
they seemed &quot;too basic,&quot; it's time to hop on the bus.  Volume 3 is the real
deal, with more solid material than you can shake a stick at.  If you find
yourself wondering how the heck Fisher pulled off the Guillotina cover on
the next AFM, BUY THE TAPE.
<p>
The ever-present Gordy Dutt was firmly planted in the Kitbuilder's
booth, showing off his latest issue of the magzine, as well as a prototype
for the first ever Kitbuilder's kit!  The kit is designed by Azimuth's Mike
James, so most folks have a fair idea of what to expect, however Gordy's
gone and tossed a curve ball by allowing the piece to function as a
pencil/brush holder or a bookend.  (Presumably for keeping all those
back-issues of KB from flopping over!)
<p>
Fred and Silvia DeRuvo flew in from California to represent Modeler's
Resource and to debut their new Sitting Pretty kit.  The kit proved quite
popular w/ female kit collectors, who were wowed by dueling paint-jobs from
Tom and Jerry.  If Tom and Jerry's table looked a little bare this year, it
was only because they had so many things on display at OTHER people's
tables!  Tom's dino buildups at the CM Studio's table were something
special.

<p>
CM Studio's table was only the tip of the iceberg for dino fans.
Saurian studios was also on-hand to display their excellent museum-quality
dinosaur displays.  These looked terrific sitting right next to Bill
Wieger's mammoth dinosaurs.  Bill was sharing his 4-5' long Triceratops
sculpture along with a pair of enormous T-Rex sculptures he did.  While
those weren't for sale, he apparently decided to sell his one-of-a-kind
Vermithrax at the show.  Sigh...
<p>
Action Hobbies continued to expand their line of Mars Attacks kits, a
popular subject at this year's show.  This year saw the addition of a
Destroying a Dog diorama, as well as a great Dave Cockrum-designed aquatic
dinosaur.  A real treat for me was Action Hobbies' Martian Warrior resin
kits cast from original stop-motion props designed for Mars Attacks.  I
snagged one quickly, and you should too if you are as much a fan as I.
(I'm frankly surprised to see that Topp's and/or Warner Bros. haven't
served these folks with C&amp;D papers after exploiting the property for
several years now.)

And while we're talking about Mars Attacks, Sassy's Satellite was
showing off a terrific 1:6 female Martian spy, complete with a choice of
Martian or Lisa Marie heads.  (Sadly, the Spookster got to her before I
did!)  Sassy's was also selling a 1:1 Martian bust based on the Topp's
comics, maybe the next best thing to the full-sized nude Martian that sold
long before the dealer room even opened.  (Say, shouldn't that nude Martian
have been displayed in the mature kits room?)

Fantasy World has continued to expand their line.  They've apparently
been busy since last year, having added a bunch of new kits to their
original line-up.  New offerings included some interesting Frog and Snail
women kits that reminded me a lot of Zotz's Orithya.  Their Dr. Nefarious
kit has been reworked slightly and is now offered emerging from a barroque
picture frame as a Dorian Grey kit.  Cool!  They were also debuting a new
Hitchcock kit, which boasted a terrific likeness, a neat little 20,000
Leagues diver diorama, and several other smaller pieces.

Anthony Taylor was playing Jack-of-all-Trades at the Weird Worx/Fashion
Victim booth.  No new kits from WW, but Anthony was kind enough to debut
the brand new Bernie Wrightson vinyl Zombie kit for Sideshow.  This kit was
a real bargain IMO, and a treat for fans of Wrightson's living dead.  For
those that purchased the &quot;Bury Christmas&quot; kit, I will warn you that the
base has been recycled.  Anthony was also displaying a range of neat pewter
jewelry (including a wild giger-esque talon/ring) and some great t-shirts
w/ designs ranging from classic horror to Soryama artwork.

GEOmetric was displaying their upcoming Predator vinyl kit.  Like their
other recent vinyl offerings, I suspect it will make fans quite happy, in
terms of quality and cost.  Geo is continuing to import Max Factory kits
and was running a show special on the pair of Wang Guyver and Guyver Zoanid
kits.  They've apparently dropped the 1:4 Pumpkinhead bust from the lineup,
but have added several new classic horror busts including the Phantom.  The
Nosferatu is still available, but with a simple &quot;post&quot; base to match the
other three busts in the series.
<p>
Fairbanx models seemed to be doing well with their Madame Quazimodo kit,
as well as the recent Ozzie/Rhodes &quot;Tribute&quot; kit.  For those that had asked
about the sculpting quality on this one, Rick Wyatt has delivered again.
You won't be disappointed.
<p>

</center>
<p>
Mental Mischefs was there immediately next to the Fairbanx table.  Of note,
they were offering a full-sized Gremlin trophy plaque!  (Put that checkbook
away Denis!)  Tick fans were amused to see a prototype of a &quot;little wooden boy&quot;
kit at the table.  (Does anyone else think this kit WON'T be cast in
resin?) Also, present was a thin resin cast &quot;shadow&quot; of the MST3K crew
that you could stick on your TV screen!  They had several sizes to choose
from based on your screen size.  Very cool!
<p>
Of course this is only a partial list of all the companies that were
selling kits at the show.  Retailers like Puff N Stuff and Kitboy were also
on hand with huge selections of kits, toys, and sundry collectibles.  The
anime selection at W'fest continues to grow, but I'll defer to Lumraptor's
expert commentary on this genre.  I will say that, despite W'fest's
&quot;anti-recast&quot; policy, I found it interesting that many of the tables
dealing anime kits were selling recasts.  Likewise, there were many tables
making a brisk business of selling bootleg video tapes.
<p>
Wonderfest '97 set new records in terms of the quantity and quality of
the contest entries.  This year, over 290 (!) entries competed for top
honors.  It was truly a spectacle to see so many wonderful pieces of
artwork on display, and I was moved to offer my sympathy to David Fisher,
whom I knew would be suffering through the judging process on Sunday
morning.  I'm not going to single out any entries in this review, because
there are just too many that are worthy of comment to list here.  Rather,
I'll let the pictures that will no-doubt accompany this article speak for
themselves.
<p>
Most people who know me, are probably expecting me to say SOMETHING
about the issue of censorship at the show and in the contest.  First, the
issue of nude kits being displayed at dealer tables was handled rather well
this year.  Most dealers made a real attempt to display their goods
carefully.  As many may know, there was an attempt made to address the
issue of censorship in the contest by offering a &quot;mature kit room,&quot; for
display of R-rated (or X-rated as it turned out) kits.  I'd like to
publically applaud the organizers of W'fest for allowing such a room to
exist.  I know it was not a popular choice for a variety of reasons, but I
want to express my appreciation to the staff for coming up with A
compromise.
<p>
If that's all there was to the show, it'd still have been terrific, but
there's more!  A horde of ravenous, resin grubbing, gremlins!  This was the
first time that I had seen so many gremlins in one place and time.  MMP3
was a kick, because there were a fair number of grems on hand, but W'fest
eclipsed that experience entirely.  There were always people to hang out
with; at the show, in rooms, and at meals.  You could literally go anywhere
in the dealer room and see a friendly/familiar face, and it's only going to
get better with time.  If you haven't had the opportunity to go to one of
the &quot;big&quot; figure kit shows, you owe it to yourself, not just to see all the
great kits, but to meet a great bunch of people.
