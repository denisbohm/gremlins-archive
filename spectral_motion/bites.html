Werewolf bust to debut at Spring Wonderfest.
<p>
<a href="../spectral_motion/alex.html"><b>Alex The Vampire</b></a> finds
enthusiastic fan base and sales are escalating. On the heels of this
successful product SMI plans to unveil their latest offering,
a stunning werewolf  bust, at the Spring 1997 Wonderfest show in
Louisville, Kentucky.
<p>
Pasadena, California February 24, 1997:  Spectral Motion Inc. is a
very busy place these days. With orders for Alex The Vampire
outperforming short term estimates the solid resin bust is a decided
hit. The demand for Alex is increasing and the 500 limited castings
will soon be gone.  In the wake of this successful product for
Spectral Motion, Mike and Mary  Elizalde, are well into production
for the second in a series of four  busts.  &quot;We're producing a
werewolf bust that will personify a sinister but highly intellectual
creature&quot; said Mike Elizalde, president and art director for the
Pasadena based effects company. &quot;We are trying to get away from the
typical raging animal  and we are focusing on the creature's ability
to use it's human intellect. Another one of our goals with our series
of busts is to break the mold, if you will, of the typical bust.
We are incorporating a great deal of dynamic motion as well as
unmistakable expression in the face&quot;  he concluded. And breaking
the mold they are.
<p>
In addition to the series of busts and the continued success of
<a href="../spectral_motion/netherlord.html"><b>Netherlord</b></a>,
SMI is tapping Hollywood's talent pool to produce a
line spectacular collectible latex masks. &quot;Special effects artist
Jordu Schell has designed three masks
(<a href="../spectral_motion/nigel.html"><b>Nigel</b></a>,
<a href="../spectral_motion/mortimer.html"><b>Mortimer</b></a>,
<a href="../spectral_motion/warrior.html"><b>Space Warrior</b></a>)
that we are currently producing.
We are very excited about the response that we are receiving and are
looking forward to the next creation that we will be debuting at
Wonderfest&quot; said Mary Elizalde, vice president  and sales executive.
<p>
Soon to join the growing line of Spectral Motion products is a
life size bust of a pensive Lon Chaney Sr., sculpted by effects
artist Aaron Sims,  longtime sculptor for Rick Baker's Cinovation Inc.
Sims has captured Chaney in a moment of deep thought in this brilliant
art piece. The piece is finished in  faux bronze patina.
It is a must have for any Lon Chaney fan and SMI is currently taking
orders.
