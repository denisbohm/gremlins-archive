<li>Water based acrylic hobby paints, such as Pactra, Polly S or Liquitex
<li>Gloss and/or matte finish lacquer
<li>Paint Brushes
<li>Drill
</ol>

<h3>MODEL BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
See the Parts Inventory, to verify that you have all parts necessary for assembly.

<h4>Step 2</h4>
Mold flashing may be trimmed from parts by gently scraping along the mold line with
the dull edge of your X-Acto Knife.  Mold lines and other surface imperfections can be
removed by wet sanding or by the  gentle use of a finishing grade sandpaper.

<h4>Step 3</h4>
Test assemble all parts to check for proper fit.  Trim and adjust fit  with sandpaper,
hobby file or Dremel tool.

<h4>Step 4</h4>
Due to the nature of the &quot;Cold Cast Porcelain&quot; manufacturing process,
the washing of parts will not be necessary.  They have been given a solvent bath as
the final stage of production, which removed excess mold release and other
paint inhibitors.

<h4>Step 5</h4>
Assemble the unpainted parts as shown in the diagram.  Use 5 minute epoxy or
super glue for all connections.  Use glue sparingly and avoid getting it on your hands
or on the surface of the model.  This kit may be completely assembled prior to
painting.
<u>Advanced modelers might prefer painting all parts before assembling.</u>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
You may fill seams  or surface imperfections with 2-Part epoxy putty.  Mix the
putty  according to the instructions on its box and press it into any seams gaps or
holes in the surface.  Wetting your fingers or using a wet toothpick will give you a
smoother finish and prevent the putty from sticking to your fingers or tools.  Do not
proceed with painting until all putty fill has hardened and been finish sanded.

<h4>Step 7</h4>
Coat the entire model with surface primer.  This will fill small pin holes,
highlight flaws in puttying and sanding and provide a uniform  surface for painting.

<h4>Step 8</h4>
Make sure the primer has completely dried before applying color.  We recommend
water based acrylic paint, which should be available at your local hobby or art/craft
store.  Refer to the box label for a suggested color scheme or create your own.  We
suggest use of an inexpensive watercolor paintbrush for paint application, a quality
fine point brush for detail work and an older or cheaper brush for dry brushing.  Rather
than applying one heavy coat of paint, it is preferable to apply several thin coats. This
will minimize the appearance of paint drips and brush strokes.
<i>The following methods will help to  &quot;professionalize&quot; your paint job...</i>

<p>
<i><u>Shading Wash </u></i>
is a technique that will achieve a sense of depth, define wrinkles and textures and will
help to give The Phantom's gown a more realistic appearance.   After applying base coat,
mix the base coat color with a small touch of black (or other dark color, such as brown
or violet).  Now thin this new color until it reaches the consistency of milk.  Apply this
wash to the model only where the effect is desired.  Note how the thinned paint gathers
in the crevices and textured areas.  Continue to apply coats of wash until desired effect
is achieved but be sure to allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next.

<p>
<i><u>Dry brushing </u></i>
will allow you to highlight bumps and wrinkles.  To do this, you should first apply a
base coat of your selected color.  Now mix a lighter version of the same color by
mixing in some white (or other light color) paint.  Soak an old paintbrush with the
new color.  Immediately begin rubbing it on a paper towel until all paint seems to
have been removed, rendering the paintbrush almost dry.  Briskly  sweep the brush
over the desired area and notice the wonderful highlights that begin to appear.

<h4>Step 9</h4>
Complete final assembly and attach the figure to the base.  Base mounting doesn't
require glue or pins, but using them wouldn't be a bad idea.  Drill holes through the
bottom of the base and into the feet.  The drill bit selected must correspond with the
diameter of the pin you will use.  Insert the pins into the holes and Glue the feet to
the base with the pins in position.
<i>Advanced modelers might consider bracing the &quot;painted&quot;
Body (A) to the &quot;painted&quot; Base (H) through the open back of the figure...
before attaching the &quot;painted&quot; Rear Gown (G). </i>

<h4>Step 10</h4>
Spray the completed model with a matte finish lacquer.  This will protect the paint
on the model from rubbing off.  Gloss lacquer can be used to &quot;spot&quot; details
such as eyes, teeth, buttons and jewels.

<p>
If you intend to occasionally remove the mask and hat, you might consider application
of flocking or some other method of softening the surface contact between the parts.
We have found that this will keep these parts from damaging the paint job on the head.

<p>
The Scarf (E) doesn't require mechanical attachment to any other parts.  It is simply
inserted into the gap between the hat and the head, to the left of the mask.  You might
consider thinning down the top of the scarf with your Dremel tool or file to aid in its
insertion and to reduce friction between parts.
