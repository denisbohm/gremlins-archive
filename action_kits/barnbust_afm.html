Action Kits International have been
producing sophisticated model kits
based on Dark Shadows, both the
newer version as well as the classic
daytime series.  The latest entry is a
striking study of Jonathan Frid as the
tragic vampire Barnabas Collins.  If
you are a fan of the TV show as I am,
this bust is a must. I like the fact that
it is a serious portrait study more than
the snarling, open mouthed vampire
you might expect.  Sculptor bill
Merklein has done a beautiful job with
the details and features, yet when I
study the likeness, I feel that there is
something slightly off in the proportions.
At the same time, when you
break down the features, they all look
correct, so I can't exactly pinpoint
what I feel the culprit might be.  I'm
probably being to knit-picky since I'm
a big fan of the character! The castings
are beautiful- I had to hunt for the
seam line and for the price, you can't
beat it. A classy piece, I recommend
it to the fans.

Now here is a piece that should
silence every critic of resin casted
sculptures.  Don't believe me? Then
check out these facts.  It's beautifully
sculpted and its cast requires no
assembly or clean up work whatsoever,
and it's inexpensive.  In fact
this is such a nice production that
you don't even have to print it for it
to look good - just set it on the shelf.
Kudos to Action Kits International and
Bill Merklein for taking the time and
effort to give resin not just a good
name, but a great one!
