<b>Geraths Illustration &amp; Sculpture</b> has a long history of working in the
scientific feild in regards to skeletal reconstruction, exhibit design,
paleontological illustrations and  restorations as well as scientific
art and illustration.
These sculptures are their first jaunt into the public domain. All of
these sculptures are researched and are completely scientificly sound in
both form and measurement.

How would you like to have a Eoraptor Lunensis staring at you from your wall
when you wake up in the morning?  Here is your chance!
Geraths Illustration &amp; Sculpture can make it happen.
Shown here is the Eoraptor lunensis sculpture while still &quot;under construction&quot;.
The finished castings will be available in July and are
sculpted as a wall mount. The mount, starting at about the 4th dorsal
vertebre, includes the forearms and sternum.

This Allosaur skull
reconstruction is based on material found at the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. This
skull resin kit is 1/1 scale and measures 8 1/4&quot; long, 3 1/2&quot; wide, 4 1/2&quot;
High and is sculpted in extreme detail. The kit includes the skull, mandible
and palate and comes unpainted. Current asking price is $150.00.
<p>
A vast amount of research was done in recreating this fossil Allosaur skull.
Currently under construction is the rest of this carnosaurs skeleton. The
full length of the skeletal cast will be 7.5 feet with a hip height of 2.5
feet. This skeletal cast will be available to the museum, exhibit and
scientific community by the end of the summer. Since the skull has been
completed and cast it is being offered as a seperate item.

<p>
<img src="../dana_geraths/velociraptor.jpg" width="209" height="144" vspace="8" hspace="8" align="left"><br>
Another skull reconstruction currently available is a 1/1 scale
Velociraptor mongoliensis. This skull, measuring 9&quot; inches in length is a
scientificly correct reconstruction of this now popular animal. This
skull was reconstructed in hopes of dispelling some of the missconceptions
about this predator and to help people better understand the REAL animal,
not it's Hollywood counterpart. This skull, like the Allosaur skull
mentioned above, comes in kit form or painted to match the fossil material
on which it is based. the kit is priced at $185.00 retail.
The painted version is priced at a reasonable $245.00 retail.
