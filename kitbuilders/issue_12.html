<b>
     The Secret For Failure:  Trying to please everybody.
</b>

<hr size="1">

<p>
Greetings!, and thanks for picking
up this twelfth (# 12) issue of
Kitbuilders Magazine. Our cover coordinated
theme this issue covers some
of the &quot;tools of the trade&quot;. (Speaking of
the cover, we would like to thank artist
Robert Hare of Columbus Ohio for his
art work that graces this issue).
<p>
Rich Larson goes over your basic
workbench repertoire of needed tools
for resin kit building. While Joe Jobe
shows what can be done to a vinyl
piece with just an excto knife, super
glue, and some clothes pins.
<p>
Also this issue we finally get to
show some reader submitted &quot;tips&quot;
and articles that had been regretfully
&quot;bumped&quot; from previous issues.
<p>
Mike Blank of Stockholm Sweden
shares with us some of his painting
secrets using Humbrol paints. His
work is impressive.
<p>
Have you ever been frustrated trying
to find a way to clean up a clear
piece of plastic that has glue stains on
it? Well, check out page #41 for an
answer to your problem.
<p>
On page four you will find the winners
of our last issues Aurora Parts
Quiz. We received a great response
from you Aurora connoisseurs out
there. We plan on similar contests in
future issues. Plus a BIG THANKS to all
of you who took the time to respond to
our questionnaire. Your input is invaluable
to us.
Enjoy!
<p>
Gordy
