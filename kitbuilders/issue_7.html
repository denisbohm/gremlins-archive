&quot;I'd rather be accused of pleasing the audience than the
critics.  I'm proud of what I've done.&quot;

Greetings and welcome to
issue #7. I borrowed that quote from
Mr. Spelling because it conveys my
thoughts about this magazine. As you
will read in this issue there is some
controversy on the recasting issue. Is
some recasting OK? Or should
anyone in possession of one be
Blacklisted? As you will see people
have varied opinions about it. Also
this magazine response on this issue is
included. Whether a &quot;please all&quot;
answer can be found remains to be
seen.
<p>
&quot;What's available&quot; you ask?
We did our best to try and answer that
for you. The amount of kits out there
even amazed us. So many that we had
to split the article into two parts.
Company's are listed in alphabetical
order, those absent from this issue will
appear in issue #8.
<p>
For those of you wanting to
try your hand at sculpting Wayne&quot;The
Dane&quot; Hanson gives you a few
pointers. Joseph Jobe shows you how
to &quot;bend&quot; Catwoman to your desires.
<p>
Plus what ever other stuff we
came up with! Enjoy!
<p>
Gordy!!!
