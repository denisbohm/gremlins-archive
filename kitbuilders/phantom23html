In the Gothic spirit of this month's KitBuilders, we're going to build
and paint the Billiken Phantom of the Opera kit. We'll also spend a
little time on the phantom base and a back wall for the completed
diorama. The good news about the Phantom kit is that it has become
somewhat more available in the last year. For awhile there the kit
became very scarce and the price got as high as $225 ... OUCH! However,
since the discontinuation of the Horizon Phantom a few more Billiken
Phantoms have made their way to the states. As a matter of fact, we've
got a couple at XO Facto going for $139.99 still a bit costly for a
vinyl kit, but hey, it's a Billiken, and it's one of their best. In my
opinion the only other Phantom kit that comes close to the Billiken is
the Delaney version [still available through M.I.M.)

<p>
There's something almost self indulgent about building Billiken kits,
like opening and savoring a really expensive bottle of wine which you
really should have left on the shelf to become more valuable. The next
time you do a Billiken kit, take a big whiff right after you've torn
open the plastic bag containing the pieces. For me, that smell is right
out of childhood. It's the same smell a lot of my toys had when I was
growing up and for a moment there, that Billiken kit helps me forget
about income tax, car payments, deadlines and all the other chains of
adulthood.

<p>
The Billiken Phantom (Ills.# 1), like the Horizon Phantom, can be built
two ways, either with the cape or without. We're going to build the kit
with the cape, the more dramatic of the two choices. Begin by washing
all the pieces in warm soapy water to remove any residual mold release.
Next, use a blow dryer to heat the parts and an Xacto knife to remove
the extra flash. Then, pour plaster of Paris in the legs. You can
probably use one of those foam fillers but when you put that cape on,
the kit becomes top-heavy and that's not good. The plaster of Paris
will help weigh the kit down. Once this is done, go ahead and prime
the kit with your favorite vinyl friendly primer. I usually use Floquil
light gray, unfortunately I had run out (and so had the local hobby
shops) when I started this article and was forced to use white and black. I started with
white on the hands, head and shirt areas. The black would come in later.
<img src=../kitbuilders/phantom23p3.jpg width=155 height=122 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

<p>
When you do a kit, it's best to come up with a painting plan. A good
rule of thumb for this is to go from lightest to darkest. It's always
easier to put black over yellow than viceversa. With this in mind I
began air brushing the shirt areas of the kit with Ceramcoat white.
Then I punched in the areas that would be shadowed by the suit jacket
with Ceramcoat charcoal, being sure to touch up the highlights with
more white (ills.. #2 & #3). 1 use Mold It Rubber and apply it with
an old airbrush needle in order to get as smooth a line as possible.
You'll apply the rubber to the shirt and both sleeves.
<img src=../kitbuilders/phantom23p4.jpg width=156 height=257 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

<p>
Since we're moving from light to dark and since the right hand is
attached to the right arm, we're going to paint the hands before
moving on to the rest of the suit and cape. To paint the hands, you'll
follow the same painting scheme used for the face, which we'll get
to in a couple of paragraphs. One neat trick to use on hands is a
technique for bringing out the veins and arteries that show through
the flesh. Once you're happy with the overall color tones of the
hands use a dark blue [ I'm using Polytranspar Sailfish Blue) and
airbrush in the lines of the veins. Do this with your compressor
set to a very low pressure and with your needle only allowing a
small amount of paint to pass through the brush. Hold the airbrush
very close to the part and make quick strokes along the vein lines.
This may take some practice but with a little diligence, you'll get
it down. Next, dull the veins with the same color scheme you used
to create the colors of the hands in the first place (ills. #5)
Again, protect your work with a dull coat. By the way, I've never
had any trouble with any of the dull coats affecting the Mold It
Rubber and hurting the paint. Mold It creates a thick enough block
to protect the paint underneath completely.
<img src=../kitbuilders/phantom23p5.jpg width=214 height=147 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

<p>
Now that the right hand is painted, you'll want to protect it before
spraying on the black primer for the jacket sleeve. Do this by wrapping
the hand in a small amount of paper towel and connecting it to the
rubber on the sleeve with masking tape (Ills. #13). Again, wait about
eight hours before actually painting the pieces, this will allow the
primer to completely dry ( I know the instructions on the can say you
should wait 24 hours but eight is usually enough). With the primer dry
I spray all the pieces with a couple of coats of Ceramcoat Black
followed up with Floquil Figure Flat. For the inside of the cape I
used dark purple.
<img src=../kitbuilders/phantom23p6.jpg width=175 height=233 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

<p>
Now it's time to remove the Mold It Rubber. Slowly peal it off,
being careful not to scratch the paint on the jacket (Ills. #B)
Although the rubber will leave a fairly smooth line, you
<img src=../kitbuilders/phantom23p7.jpg width=190 height=186 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

<p>
will probably still have to clean up some of the residual paint
flakes. I do this by taking a Q-tip and cutting it in half to create
a sharp edge on the cotton stick. Then I use that edge to clean up the
paint line (Ills. #9). You will still have to go back and paint in a
completely straight edge around all the lines of the shirt and sleeves.
For the Ascot (Ills. # 10) 1 used Ceramcoat Black Cherry and did the
shadows by mixing Black cherry with some Black. I painted the buttons
on the shirt black and the buttons on the cape silver just for a change
of pace. Next I used Polytranspar Wet Look Gloss on the shoes
[ Ills. #11) and on the buttons.
<img src=../kitbuilders/phantom23p8.jpg width=187 height=226 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

<p>
For the face I decided to try something new. I began by spraying the
face with Floquil white primer (Ills. # 1 2A) then I used Liquitex
Acrylic Wood Stain - Charcoal to darken all of the lines and shadows
(Ills. #1 2B). Simply paint on the stain then wipe most of it away
with a Q-Tip. The idea here is that as the paint is applied, the stain
will keep the lines and shadows dark. What I was trying for with the
color scheme was to create the effect of burned and healed flesh which
is why I combined the basic pink flesh tone with a lot of yellow and
orange. the colors referred to for the face are all Polytranspar Acrylic
Airbrush Paint. Illustration # 1 2C shows the effect of a couple coats
of Whitetail Ear Medium (sort of a pinKizh color). I followed thiq up
with a couple of coats of Transpar Orange and more Whitetail. Next, I
used some Sailfish Blue and Lavender Flesh to create some monstrous
shadows around the eyes and under the cheek bones (Ills. # 1 2E). I
then applied more Whitetail to even out the highlights and some mars
Red to create a shadow around the hairline. After this, I continued
working shades of Whitefowl Base Yellow, Transpar Orange, Whitetail
and Whitetail mixed with some Superhide White for highlights
(Ills. # 1 2G]. nce completely happy with the flesh tones, I sprayed
the head with Floquil Figure Flat.
<img src=../kitbuilders/phantom23p9.jpg width=152 height=241 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

<p>
The brushed-in detail work began with Ills. #12H. Here I've covered
the eyeballs with Ceramcoat Tompte Red and the teeth and gums with
Ceramcoat Black Cherry. For most kits, I wouldn't have used Tompte
Red for the eyes but since the Phantom is pretty monstrous looking,
I figured I could get away with it. Next I used white mixed with just
a small amount of charcoal for the eyeball and light ivory for the
teeth (Ills. # 1 3A). the white on the eyeball should be applied very
lightly, almost a wash, to avoid obscuring the very subtle iris molded
into the eye. The shadows around the eyes were done with a mixture of
Midnight Blue, Purple and Black. The first layer of the iris is black
(Ills. #1 3B) Illustration #1 3C shows the completed eyes. The sequence
of colors I used for the eye is as follows: outer iris black, inner
iris dark turquoise with turquoise highlights on both sides and a very
light turquoise to highlight the highlight and finally black for
the pupil. Illustration #13D shows the almost completed face. H ere
I've added Liquitex Woodstain Sherry to stain the teeth, painted the
hair black with some dry brushed blue highlights, and softened the
shadows beneath the eyes with a flesh toned wash. Use Floquil figure
flat to protect the finished paint job then gloss the teeth and eyes
with Polytranspar Wet Look Gloss.
<img src=../kitbuilders/phantom23p1.jpg width=244 height=193 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

<p>
Finally, I used a Red Iron Oxide on the fingernails to create the
shadows around the nails (ills. # 14).
<img src=../kitbuilders/phantom23p1.jpg width=244 height=193 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

<p>
We are now ready to assemble the completed kit. Use a blow dryer to
heat the pieces before assembling. The only parts I glued were the
jacket to the pants and the cape to the back of the jacket. Everything
else just snaps into place. You may want to do a little extra trimming
to make assembly as smooth as possible, that way you won't risk hurting
the paint job.

<p>
The Phantom base is pretty straight forward to build and paint, just
take your time on the keys which can be extremely tedious.
<img src=../kitbuilders/phantom23p11.jpg width=244 height=153 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

<p>
The back wall was sculpted out of balsa foam with Fleck Stone used
to create the texture (Ills. # 15). The wall hanging is simply a cloth
napkin from Target.
<img src=../kitbuilders/phantom23p12.jpg width=244 height=73 hspace=8 vspace=8 align=right>

<p>
Illustrations # 16, # 17, # 18 show the completed kit on the base with
a few Doll Shop extras (like the candelabra) for realism.
