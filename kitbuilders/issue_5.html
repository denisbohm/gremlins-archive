 Greetings and welcome to issue #5
of Kitbuilders and Glue Sniffers.
First I must direct a few comments to
the kit producers. The magazine cannot
help to promote your product if we do
not know anything about it. In other
words it is up to you to supply the
magazine with photos and information
about your kit line. Please do not assume
that if you tell Terry Webb about
your kit that it will automatically show
up in this publication. Granted, Terry is
an enormous help and source of information
for this magazine, but he is a
very busy guy, and try as he may, cannot
be a PR man for everyone. Again it
comes back to you the kit producer,
the more advertising avenues you use,
the more potential customers you can
cultivate. Simply put, your potential
for profit rises with the number of
people who know about you. As a very
smart man once told me, the first three
rules of business are 1) Advertise, 2)
Advertise, 3) Advertise. K.B.G.S. has
some of the lowest ad rates in the hobby
(Yes this is a self plug!) and to those
who do not already take advantage of
this, we just think you should.
<p>
So now please take advantage of all
the work and long hours that the staff
and article contributors have put into
this issue - Enjoy!
