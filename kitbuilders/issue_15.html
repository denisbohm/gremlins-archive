Salutations model kit assemblers, and welcome to
issue #15.
<p>
Does that kit that you were so proud of when
you first finished it now have that run down tired
look? Have you been thinking that maybe a &quot;nip&quot;
here and a &quot;tuck&quot; there might bring back it's
healthy glow? Well find yourself a surgical saw,
some coat hangers &amp; putty, and a cute nurse
and do some &quot;doctoring (The cute nurse is
optional.) This issue Rich Larson tries to coax
you into finally having the nerve to chop up that
$100+ model kit into a new pose. He guides you
along on the changes he made to his
<a href="deadman.html"><b>Deadman</b></a>
kit. (The results of his labors can be seen on this
issues cover.)
<p>
KBM readers also sent in some examples of
their&quot;doctored&quot; kits. These photos emphasize
the point that there are some truly talented and
creative modelers out there.
<p>
Early&quot;95&quot; had it's share of big model kit
shows. Mark Paskell shares his Mad Model
Party experiences in this issue's &quot;California
Connection&quot;. Also covered are Wonderfest 95,
and the spring Chiller Theatre show.
<p>
Contributing writer/modeler Jim Bertges
had a &quot;howling&quot; good time putting together his
own diorama, titled &quot;Full Moon Rider&quot;. He shows
us how to take advantage of those broken 3
3/4&quot; action figures.
<p>
Again, the piece we had planned for those
vintage Hawk Weird-Ohs kits had to be put to the
side. We'll get it in one of these days.<br>
Enjoy!
<p>
STORK HAS A HERNIA DEPT: A hearty congratulations
to Rich and Krista Larson on the birth of
their twin boys, Mitchell &amp; Brent. Future modelers
for sure.
