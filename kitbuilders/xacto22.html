Welcome to this issues installment. This time out I'm
going to share with you some modeling tricks I've stumbled
upon over the years. They're the sort of things that haven't
come up in any of the previous Xacto Facto articles but
which you may find handy at some point in the future.
 <p>

Before we get started I'd like to comment on the recent
controversy surrounding the Blank and Generic kits. I think
it's extremely unfortunate that both sides of this dispute
started pointing fingers and name calling. Anybody remember
a few years ago when all those child/adult switch-a-roo
movies came out? There was one with the kid from &quot;Wonder
Years&quot;, one with Duddley Moore, another with George
Burns, and I even think there was a female version, not to
mention Big which worked with similar themes. It was almost
as if a memo went out to each of the studios saying make
this movie. My point is that sometimes two different people
can come up with the same idea, say one person in
California and another in Texas. It just happens and sometimes
it's just plain old coincidence. As our hobby grows, and
every day there seems to be a new company producing kits,
we are bound to run into situations where two, maybe three
people come up with the same idea. Let us hope that in the
future we can all take the high road in these situations and
give our fellow model makers the benefit of the doubt before
pointing fingers and making accusations.
<p>

 This situation has become personal for me because I
recently found out that a fellow producer of kits has accused
me of stealing the idea of the X-O Facto Phantom Base from
him. I understand that he has gone so far as to write an article
discussing this. Since I haven't read the article I don't
know if he has named X-O Facto or myself as being guilty of
stealing this idea. Since I believe that reputation means a lot
in this business I am very concerned. For this reason, I'd like
to explain how I got the idea for the Phantom Base. Check
out page 33 of issue number 214 of Famous Monsters of
Filmland. It's an ad for Monsters in Motion and near the bottom
is a photograph hawking the sale of the Billiken
Phantom. The Phantom is shown standing on a base with an
organ, a music stand, a violin, sheet music and a number of
other items from the scene in the movie. Before the MIM
price, the phrase &quot;No Base&quot; appears in parentheses. MIM
has been running this photo for years and it occurred to me
that with the &quot;no base&quot; disclaimer, they must be getting some
interest in the base. Since a lot of people already own one of
the Phantom kits it only made sense to offer the base as a
kit. For the record, that base was created by hobby icon
David Fisher and it was the inspiration behind the X-O Facto
Phantom Base. I've discussed the base with David and at no
time did he suggest that I stole the idea from him. I had no
knowledge of anyone else releasing a Phantom kit on a base
with an organ when I came up with the idea of doing our
Phantom Base. What really makes this situation disturbing is
that I have the utmost respect for the kits produced by this
person and will no doubt, add their new Phantom kit to my
collection. I believe the path to understanding (and world
peace for that matter) comes through communication and
therefore invite anyone who ever has a problem with
anything I've done to call me and discuss the situation.
 <p>

 .. Speaking of the Phantom Base, after getting some
feedback on the initial release of the kit, we have done some
refining. The organ and a number of the parts in the kit have
been remolded. The new improved Phantom Base is available
at the same price as the original. Also, I'd like to thank
the folks at Cellar Cast for allowing me to include their
Phantom and Bride name plates with those bases.
<p>

Other new kits now available from X-O Facto include a
San Francisco Police Detective who wants to know if you feel
lucky (sculpted by Pat Delany), the Bully based on a monster
from Godzilla's Pevenge, and a smaller two figure kit from the
same film called The Bully v. Baby G., both kits sculpted by
Brian Hug, first place winner of the G Con scratch built contest.

Okay, on with the information segment of our show.
<p>
Tip One: The first tip came out of doing The Taxi Driver
kit for a retail client. On the base of that kit there are supposed
to be couple of soda cans and a magazine. Well, although the
soda cans looked like soda cans, the lump of resin that was supposed
to be the magazine, didn't look like anything even resembling
a magazine. Then it occurred to me that magazines often run
miniature photos of their covers in their subscription and back
issue ads (as KitBuilders often does). I picked up a gun magazine
and sure enough found an ad that featured a miniature photo of one
of the back issues. I cut out the miniature magazine cover and an
<img src="../kitbuilders/xacto22p2.jpg" width="244" height="132" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">

equally proportioned section for the back cover. (Ills. #1). I
then cut out some loose pages to make up the inside of the
magazine and glued it all together with Elmers glue. From
here I took the idea a step further with the help of my trusty
computer. Utilizing a desktop publishing package that came
with a bunch of clip art, I created the sheet music, medical
charts, and book pages shown in Ills. #2. With a little imagination
you can use computer generated miniatures to add an
extra element of realism to kits and dioramas. If you don't own
a computer, check your local library, many of them have computers
and software that can be used by the general public.

<p>

Tip Two: Let's talk shiny. So, you've airbrushed your kit,
you've painted the eyes, lips, teeth and any other detail work
that needed to be brushed in and you've sealed the whole
thing with dull coat, time to gloss the eyes, teeth, and what-
ever else needs glossing. I started off doing my glossing with
Liquitex Gloss Medium and then graduated to Pactra Acrylic
Gloss Clear. Now I use Polytranspar Wet Look Gloss (No.
240). (Ills. #3) 1 know, I know, it says right on the label
&quot;Airbrush Paint&quot;, well, sometimes you have to break the
rules. I find that Polytranspar Wet Look Gloss gives the shiniest
finish yet, and yes, you can brush it on. Use two thin
coats. Brush the first on, let it dry and then brush on the
second. Try it, see what you think. The Polytranspars, by the
way, are taxidermy paints that come in a variety of vibrant
colors, transparent colors, and opaque colors. Also, you can
use the Polytranspars as a wash. Be sure that your base
paint has been sealed with a dull coat, then use a very fine
brush to paint in the smallest indents, creases or wrinkles,
working them one at a time. Once you've painted in the wrinkle,
immediately use a slightly damp Q-Tip to wipe off any
excess, leaving only the smallest amount in the deepest part
of the wrinkle or crease. Again, try it and see what you think.

<p>
      Tip Three: Okay, so you've finished your kit, you've created
    your own base but something's still missing ... a name
    plate. What to do? Well, start off by visiting one of my
    favorite haunts, your local well stocked model railroad store.
    That's where I picked up the plastic letters shown in Ills #4.
    You can use these on either a piece of sheet styrene or on
    a sculpted background like the one I've used. If you can't find
    a name plate for that favorite kit, try this.
    <img src="../kitbuilders/xacto22p5.jpg" width="244" height="142" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">

<p>
      Tip Four: Let's say you've finished your kit and have
    somehow managed to put a hair line crack into that carefully
    sanded, seamless shoulder joint you worked so hard on
    sanding smooth. Now, it's just a crack, the rest of the arm
    is still firmly glued in place and you don't want to use glue or
    putty for fear of screwing up the paint job. Try Model Magic
    (Ills. #5). Model Magic has a spackle like consistency but; is
    completely water soluble, even after it dries. Simply take a little
    bit on the tip of your finger and spread it across the crack.
    Use a wet paper towel to wipe off the excess, wait until it dries
    and then touch it up by either airbrushing or dry brushing.
    <img src="../kitbuilders/xacto22p6.jpg" width="244" height="146" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">

<p>
      Tip Five: Here is an assortment of tools that can come
    in handy for any number of model making situations (Ills. #6).
    The circle guides came from the architecture section of a
    local art store. In addition to circles, you can get guides for
    squares, triangles, rectangles and just about any other
    shape you can think of, perfect for creating that space ship
    hatch or manhole cover. The next item is made by X-acto
    Knives and is used for creating parallel lines, perfect for
    marking and cutting styrene sheets, balsa wood or foam
    board. Next is the X-acto razor saw and meter box, used for
    making straight and perfect 45 degree cuts. Compare the
    pieces of balsa wood on the left to the pieces of balsa wood
    on the right in (Ills. #7). The pieces on the left were cut with
    the meter box while the ones on the right were cut with just
    a blade. Check out Anthony Mestas' article in Amazing
    Figure Modeler #6 for additional uses of the meter box.
    Finally, the jewelers saw which can be used to make any
    number of delicate angled cuts in plastic or wood. All of
    these items can be used to improve your modeling skills.
    <img src="../kitbuilders/xacto22p7.jpg" width="244" height="126" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">

<p>
      Tip Six: Here's one for those of you who have taken the
    plunge into the realm of mold making. You can make an
    almost perfect one-piece mold by mounting your original up-
    side-down in a plastic cup (Ills. #8). Simply pour in the rubber,
    allow it to dry and then cut away the plastic cup. Cut the
    mold on one side, remove your original piece, and cut a hole
    in the top of the mold from which to pour in the resin. Once
    you're ready to cast your piece, simply place the mold in a
    plastic cup (the same size as the first cup) and pour the
    resin. You end up with an almost perfect piece with a mold
    line just up one side. Many thanks to Pat Delaney for sharing
    this mold making technique.
