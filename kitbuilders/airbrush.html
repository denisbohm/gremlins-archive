<font SIZE="+3"><b>The Workings of an Airbrush</b></font>
</center>

It was brought to my attention that in the last issue I
explained how to paint with an airbrush, but I did not really cover
how an airbrush works. For this issue I am going to explain the
workings of the AZTEK 3000S double action airbrush. I am
using this model because it is the type that I use often and am
most comfortable with.
<p>
The Aztek 3000S is very user friendly for first time airbrush
users. It is light, easy to clean and simple to use. First, the body
of the brush is streamlined and lightweight. Second, if you purchase
the airbrush kit you will get four tips that will take care of
high flow, general purpose, fine line, and splatter effect.
<p>

<p>
The first tip I will use is the turquoise, which is the high flow
tip. The high flow is for doing large areas with a lot of paint. Like
applying a base coat to this predator trophy. You can also use
thicker paints with a high flow tip.
<p>
<center><img src="airbrush2.jpg" width="288" height="216"></center>
<p>
The next tip I will use is the gray tip. This tip is a general
purpose tip. It has a wide range of uses. With the general purpose
tip I can do gradual shading, I can create the different patterns
on the predator's head and face. With the general purpose
tip you will need to thin your paints. (Which I recommend
for all tips.)
<p>
<center><img src="airbrush3.jpg" width="150" height="216"></center>
<p>
The next tip is the tan tip which is my fine line tip. With the
fine line tip I can do exactly what the name says. I can produce
fine lines, detail work and very fine mists. I will use it to put the
finishing details on the Predator's face. With the fine line tip I
will make the paint very thin.
The last tip I am going to describe is the pink tip, which is
my spatter tip. I will not be using this tip on my Predator but
will describe its uses. The spatter tip is used for creating stippling
affects (a lot of dots spaced apart at different densities to
create shading or patterns). It's great for creating stone affects,
cloth patterns and textures.
<p>
That is basically all there is to the different tips for the Aztek
3000S.
<p>
Now I am going to explain the workings of the double action
trigger on this airbrush.
<p>
After you have assembled the airbrush as the instructions
tell you, (which is very simple to accomplish), this airbrush can
be used in a single action or double action manner.
<p>
To use single action is simply to be able to press down on
the trigger and get paint out of the brush. To do this the Aztek
3000S has an adjustment roller on the back of the brush. Just
press the trigger and adjust this roller until the correct amount
of paint that you desire comes out of the tip. Once that adjustment
is reached, then you can press down on the trigger and
get the same steady flow every time. To get a larger or smaller
flow, adjust the roller and repeat the process.
<p>
<table width="544" bgcolor="000000" cellpadding="8">
<tr valign="top" bgcolor="ffffff">
<td>1.) Press trigger down completely.  Do not pull trigger back.</td>
<td><img src="airbrushs1.gif" width="296" height="144"></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" bgcolor="ffffff">
<td rowspan="2">2.) Adjust roller so that desired amount of spray is emitted.
To increase or decrease amount of spray adjust roller.</td>
<td><img src="airbrushs2.gif" width="296" height="144"></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" bgcolor="ffffff">
<td><img src="airbrushs3.gif" width="296" height="144"></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" bgcolor="ffffff">
<td>3.) Downward pressure on trigger without pulling back will
repeat the line.</td>
<td><img src="airbrushs4.gif" width="296" height="144"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
To use this brush in a double action manner is going to take
a little more practice, but once you get the hang of it you will
have no problems. Double action is where the amount of air and
paint are controlled by only the trigger. Pushing down and forwards
or backwards on the trigger will determine the amount of
paint coming out of the brush. To increase the amount of paint
spray, just pull the trigger back. To decrease the amount of paint
spray, just move the trigger forward.
<p>
<table width="544" bgcolor="000000" cellpadding="8">
<tr valign="top" bgcolor="ffffff">
<td>1.) Press down on trigger until it bottoms out.  Do not pull back.
Adjust roller so no media is discharged when trigger is fully depressed.</td>
<td><img src="airbrushd1.gif" width="296" height="144"></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" bgcolor="ffffff">
<td>2.) Begin pulling trigger back and hold it.  Adjust roller so that
a small amount of media is discharged (fine line).</td>
<td><img src="airbrushd2.gif" width="296" height="144"></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" bgcolor="ffffff">
<td rowspan="2">3.) To increase spray pull trigger back.  To decrease
spray push forward.</td>
<td><img src="airbrushd3.gif" width="296" height="144"></td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top" bgcolor="ffffff">
<td><img src="airbrushd4.gif" width="296" height="144"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
That is about it for using the Aztek 3000S airbrush.
<p>
Clean up with the Aztek 3000S is very simple. You just run
airbrush thinner through the brush until it comes out clean.
There is no major disassembling needed. Although I will usually
soak the paint reservoir and the tips in water to make sure they
are completely clean.
<p>
Another very nice thing about the Aztek 3000S is its
design. It is designed to be held in your hand like a paint brush,
pen, or pencil. You don't have a large jar hanging off the bottom
of the brush or hose attached to awkward places that get in
your way.
<p>
As I said, this is only one type of airbrush and they all have
their pros and cons. I am not trying to get anyone to buy this
airbrush over any other. This is the airbrush that I use most and
am the most comfortable with. So use whatever you are most
comfortable with or are currently using, but if you are just starting
out in airbrushing, you might want to give this one a try.
<p>
Note: This is the same airbrush produced by <i>Model Master</i>.
If you want to learn a lot more about airbrushing, pick up a copy
of <i>Airbrush Action Magazine</i> (see this issues &quot;Cool New&quot; section).
Have fun airbrushing!
