A WORD FROM THE EDITOR
<p>
&quot;Greetings fellow glue-sniffers!
&quot;Now I started with that line
for two reasons. First,
to get your attention,
and second to say what
the topic of this
soap-box speech is about;
namely the title of this
mag!
<p>
I WANT TO SAY FOREMOST,
THAT THIS MAGAZINE IS IN
NO WAY-SHAPE-OR FORM,
PROMOTING DRUG USAGE.
<p>
My choice for a title
came from my memories as a
wee lad, sitting at my moms
folding card table in my
bedroom, inhaling the vapors
of an open testers tube
of glue, lying next to the
scattered parts of my new
Aurora kit. I just thought
that headaches and dizziness
were all part of kit
building!! I know they said
&quot;use only in a well ventilated
area&quot;, but come on..
How many of us use to
huddle over the table trying
to get FRANKENSTEIN'S
coat halfs to fit right, or
held DRAC so close our eyes
crossed trying to paint his
fangs and ring. And don't
forget using the instruction
sheet as a drop cloth.
<p>
Anyhow, the point is that
this publication is intended
as a source for Safe
Escapism. No fat or cholesterol;
and easy on the liver.
<p>
So here's to the first
issue, and to hopefully
many more. I hope you
like it!
<p>
Thanks
<br>
Gordy!!
