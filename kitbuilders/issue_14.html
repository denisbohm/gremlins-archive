Greetings! Welcome to issue #14 of
KitBuilders Magazine. In this issue, we
provide you some pointers and suggestions
on photographing your models. You
have spent days and days working on a kit,
now you would like to take it even further
to give it that realistic look. Or maybe you
would just like a nice clear photo of it. We
hope this issue encourages you to give it a
shot.
<p>
The front and back cover are the results
of the combined building and photographing
talents of Paul Gill and Carlos Sendra. [Both
from New York.] You can read more about
how these guys do this in this issues feature
article. Jim Bertges also shares with
us the basics for taking good photos. He
covers what you need to get started and
fills you in on some photo do's and
don'ts&quot;.
<p>
Have you picked up a pre-painted kit
and would like to
<a href="strip.html"><b>strip</b></a>
it so you can repaint
it your own way? Then Rich Larson is here
to help you out. He covers some of the
methods that he has used to strip paint
and shares his findings with you.
<p>
Joe Jobe takes a Kaiyodo C-3PO and
customizes it to the point where you would
swear Anthony Daniels is inside it. He also
reviews and includes customizing tips for
GEOmetric's new Medusa kit.
<p>
Greg Martin of Australia publishes
Science Fiction Modeller magazine. He
shares with us, in words and photos, the
modeling scene in Australia.
<p>
Matt McWhirt (who heads up The Shape
Of Things) sent us a great piece on mold
anomalies. He did this to help the builder
or collector have a better understanding of
the problems involved in the actual production
of resin kits.
<p>
Last but not least, Mark Kaelin
reveals to us &quot;the married modelers
predicament&quot;.
