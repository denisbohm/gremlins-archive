&quot;Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions.  Small people
always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can
become great.&quot;<br>

  &quot;It was a dark and gloomy issue.&quot;  Slightly altering Snoopy's famous opening
line seemed appropriate for this &quot;Gothic issue.  John Garcia spoke with
some of the more recognizable names of the hobby that produce and / or enjoy
&quot;darker&quot; related figure kits that exist (himself included).  those that appreciate
the gothic theme, a lot of times, tend to be quickly judged because of their &quot;weird&quot; likes.
this article lets you see that many of us probably have similar likes and dislikes.  After
all, figures have always been on the fringe of main stream modeling, some just take them a little
further out.  Cover kit:  Bilikens Bracula with custom made base, by David Fisher.
<p>
  Tis the Summer show season and we have coverage of three of them in this issue.
Chiller, wonderfest, and Chicago's first Rezn Hedz show.
<p>
  Keeping with our &quot; Gothic&quot; theme John Tucky <a href="phantom23.html"> Xacto Facto</a> builds and paints
a Kiliken Phantom of the Opera.  He also includes an elaborate base to position his
finished piece on.  Wayne &quot;The Dane&quot; Hansen tries to entice us to be more
creative and imaginative with our kits.  By paying attention to what other hobby's do we can learn tricks and tips that will
help to enhance our own peices.  Al Reboiro Shares with you his way of stripping paint (and glue)
from those old classic styrene kits.
Al and Ed Bowkley (Chiller Show coverage) pull
double duty this issue with a shared peice titled, &quot;Trading 101&quot;.  Ed and Al
hold class on the finer points of trading for kits at a show.
<p>
  Jean Elliott &quot;gets heavy: this issue with a review of an early Streamline Picture
Modelworks' kit, Heavy Metal.
<p>
  Of course we won't forget our own dynamic duo, Mark Paskell and Rich Larson.  As always they
come through as promised.
Mark, giving us the movieland scoop, and Rich sharing his painting skills &amp; kit reviews.<br>
ENJOY!!
