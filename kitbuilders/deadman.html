<font SIZE="+3"><b>Repositioning Deadman</b></font>
</center>

<p>
For this issue, I am going to show how I repositioned a solid resin figure of
a DC comic character.. Deadman. The repositioning of a resin kits takes a little
more time and thought, because to do this I have to cut sections out of the
figure and resculpt new sections in. The whole idea of taking a $100 or $200
resin kit and cutting it apart to modify it can be more than a little intimidating
when you don't know if the kit will turn out as a piece of art or a piece of junk.
So I will show and explain to you what I did with my Deadman kit and hopefully
it will get you motivated.
<p>
First, always start by cleaning the kit of any leftover mold release and sand
any mold lines. The main figure came in four pieces which consist of the legs
and torso (which was one piece), two lower arm sections, and the head. When
built straight from the box, he is positioned on a tombstone base looking as if
he is going to start doing jumping jacks. I decided I wanted a more dramatic
pose. After studying the kit and seeing how I could reposition it without changing
the proportions of the figure, I decided I
wanted to put Deadman in a kneeling position
next to the tombstone. I also wanted him holding
a skull in his right hand (like a scene from
Hamlet).
<p>

</center>
<p>
To accomplish this task, I first had to cut
the figure apart (scary). I cut the lower legs
away from the torso and then again at the
knees (cutting just under the knee caps). Next,
I cut the right arm off at the elbow. I also cut
the toes off the feet so they could be repositioned
to give the figure a more natural look
when finished. The cut at the waist was needed
so that I could reposition the upper body
slightly forward.
<p>
<img src="rd3.jpg" width="139" height="216" hspace="8" align="right">
Next, I am going to cut some resin from
the parts I just separated to make room for
the repositioning and resculpting. First, I start
with the neck. I am tipping the head forward
slightly so I will need to remove some resin
from the front of the neck. To do this I measured
down the front of the neck a 1/4&quot; and marked it. Then I used my Exacto
saw and cut from the mark on the front of the neck through to the top of the
back of the neck, removing a &quot;V&quot; shaped wedge. Next, I repeated the above
described process at the waist just under the belt line to allow the upper torso
to be moved forward. For the legs I had to cut about a 1/2&quot; &quot;V&quot; shaped wedge
off the back of the knees. This would allow me to have some
&quot;working room&quot; when repositioning the legs to a 45 degree
angle. For the right arm I cut a 1/2&quot; &quot;V&quot; shaped wedge off
the inside of the elbow. This was to allow room for the modifications
I planned, which was to make the right arm bend
at a 90 degree angle.
<p>
When I decided to reposition the toes of both feet, I again
used a &quot;V&quot; cut to remove resin from the top of the foot so
that the toes could be moved in an upward position. With
the toes I did not know how much I needed to remove, so l
started with a small cut. This allowed me the option of
removing more if I needed to. I continued to do this until I
had the toes repositioned as I wanted them.
<p>
(NOTE: ALL INITIAL CUTS CAN BE ROUGH, I TEST FIT THEM
FIRST THEN GO BACK AND CLEAN THE SURFACES SO THEY
FIT TOGETHER PROPERLY.)
<p>
Now that all the parts were cut and trimmed, I was ready
to start pinning and reassembling the figure.
<p>
For the toes, waist and neck I just pinned these parts
together as I do for any other kit. (NOTE: I did not glue the
waist joint at this point, because it allows for easier handling
and working.) For the knees and right arm the pinning is
going to be a little trickier.
First I used longer pins
than were needed. For the
knees I used 2&quot; pins that
were made from a clothes
hanger. I then
drilled about a 1/2&quot; into
the upper and lower legs
and placed the pins into
them. This gave me a 1&quot;
gap between the leg sections. This I needed so I
could resculpt the knees
that I had cut out. Next I
bent the pins into a 45
degree angle. To glue
these pins into the legs I
used a five minute epoxy
because I wanted the
extra strength at these
weak joints. For the right
elbow I repeated the
above process with a 2
inch pin, but this pin will be
bent into a 90 degree
angle. The wire
between the sections of
legs and right arm acted
as an armature to apply
putty to for resculpting the
sections I was missing.

<p>
Next I started the resculpting process. (Now I am definitely not John Dennett, so
you will have to bear with me on this.) I started by applying
epoxy putty around the wires in the right arm and legs and
allowing it to dry. I then applied another layer of epoxy putty
and built it up to the size of the surrounding area.
With the putty still soft I roughed in the shape of the right
elbow and both knees (NOTE: use good reference material to
make sure that the elbow and knees look accurate). I also
tried to match the surface texture and style of the piece so
that the areas I was resculpting blended in well with the rest
of the kit.
<p>

<p>
<img src="rd8.jpg" width="159" height="216" hspace="8" align="right">
After the putty I applied
had plenty of time to dry and
cure (I let it sit 24 hours), I
used my Dremel tool with a
stone sanding bit for
smoothing and shaping of
the areas. After that
process was finished I followed it up with 400 grit
sand papeer and some hand
sanding.
<p>
Up until this point I had
been working with the top
and bottom halves separately, so I attached the upper
torso to the lower body.
After pinning and gluing,
applying putty at the seam and blending it in with the rest of
the waist, Deadman was complete. As a final touch to the
figure I added a full skull (in
the same scale) in Deadman's
right hand.
<p>
<img src="rd9.jpg" width="142" height="216" hspace="8" align="left">
Lastly there were a couple
of areas on the base that I
needed to correct. First I had
to fill in the two foot print
indentations that Deadman
original stood in. I filled them
with epoxy putty and blended
in the surface texture. Next I
had to use my Dremel tool
and cut out two new spots
where Deadman's toes would
rest. To do this I traced a pattern from Deadman's toes
onto the base and removed that area with a cutting bit
in my Dremel tool.
<p>
<img src="rd10.jpg" width="138" height="216" hspace="8" align="right">
Now the figure of Deadman and the base are complete and ready for priming and painting.
<p>
I know how intimidating it is to cut apart a figure kit
that you just saved two months to purchase, but I think
if you take your time and give it a try you will be pleased
with your results. I hope that this article will encourage
some of you to try and modify your kits. GOOD LUCK !!!
<p>
<b>A final note:</b> <i>Due to the sculpting and position of
some kits, not all figures can be repositioned without
changing the proportions of the figures, so study the figure well before cutting it apart.</i>
