Greetings! You have before you issue
# 13 of KitBuilders Magazine. This
issues cover is brought to you by the
customizing talents of Joe Jobe. Check
out his Vinyl Review column and you
can read more about this kit conversion
and how putties played a role in it.
Rich Larson also shows you some of
his puttying techniques for those bothersome
air bubbles and seam gaps
<p>
We take a look back at some of
Aurora's earliest figure kit releases;
this time we cover the Guy's and Gal's
series.
<p>
A hearty welcome back to Mark
Casket. Due to the fact that he was
only born with two hands, two feet and
one head, he missed our deadline date
last issue. Now that he has learned
how to do the work of three people,
he's back on that scheduling track.
<p>
Sandra Garrity enlightens us to the
possible uses of metal miniature figures
in larger scale modeling.
<p>
We poke a little photo fun at this
years Halloween Chiller Show. Also
included is a very special full page Terry
Webb poster. Terry has been the
&quot;butt&quot; of a few jokes, we hope this
poster shows our strong support for
him .
<p>
We finally got around to putting
together some tips and suggestions on
submitting articles and photos. You
can find this information towards the
back of this issue.
Hope you enjoy!
Gordy
