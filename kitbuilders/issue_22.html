A big &quot;Wookie&quot; welcome to issue #22,
as we jump on the Star Wars revival band
wagon. This issue's cover kit (Kaiyodo's
Boba Fett) was built, painted and
customized by our own Joe Jobe. You can
read how Joe customized this piece with a
lightsaber. (Just kidding about the
lightsaber.) Boy, did we get some
responses on last issues recasting article.
They came by phone, letters, and e-mail.
You can read some of them in this issue.
We know there's quite a bit of reading there,
but it just goes to show that people have
strong opinions on this topic. (We know that
some may feel that this is a waste of
magazine space. Though as we've said
before, &quot;this is your hobby&quot; and you should
know what's going on in it.)
<p>
Once again our &quot;Hollywood insider&quot;,
Mark Paskell, gives you the scoop on new
movies in the works. Movies that most likely
will spawn new kits. Mike Fredericks
takes us back twenty years, when Star Wars
models were &quot;new&quot;. Joe Jobe also gives us
his favorite picks from the Star Wars figure
kits that are currently available. In the
&quot;Plastic Injection&quot; Joe answers some
questions, frequently asked of him, about
styrene kits. Rich Larson does some house
cleaning and comes up with some kit
customizing ideas. Plus he shares his
opinion with you on seventeen new kits that
are now available. Speaking of tips and
sharing, John Tucky does the same thing in
his <a href="xacto22.html"> Xacto Facto</a> column. Jean Elliot is back,
and this time he tackles a figure that is a
cross between an Alien and a
Predator.... the Hybrid.
<p>
In closing, the words of a great man
from New Jersey come to mind, &quot;it's just a
hobby&quot; keep it fun. ENJOY!!!
<p>
PS: It you haven't yet, try to attend one
of the model shows coming up this year.
It's a great way to put faces with names,
make new friends and contacts, and of
course... see and buy &quot;cool&quot; kits.
