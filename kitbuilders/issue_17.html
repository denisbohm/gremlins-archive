To fulfill a dream, to be allowed to sweat over
lonely labor, to be given a chance to create,
is the meat and potatoes of life. The money is
the gravy.

Hello lovers of inanimate objects, and welcome
to issue #17 of KitBuilders Magazine. In
this issue we praise the female form. (Those
made of plastic, vinyl and resin.) In doing an issue
like this one we have come to the conclusion that
this is definitely a male dominated hobby. What
we mean is that the amount of kits and figures
based on our &quot;better half's&quot; is quite extensive. So
much so that we will continue this female figure
kit accolade in our next issue. Meanwhile check
out Jean Elliott's piece titled &quot;Where have all the
women gone?&quot;
<p>
You say that you have not yet found the perfect
female kit for your collection! Well,
<a href="sculpting_an_angel.html"><b>try sculpting
your own</b></a>. Mike James gives you step by step
instructions on how to do just that.
<p>
You finally got that Bride kit and now you want to
put some background behind her. John Tucky
can help you out with his article on building the
Brides table.
<p>
Along with his popular kit reviews this issue,
Rich Larson takes the time to answer some of
your building and painting questions. Paul Gill and
associates introduce you to a sculptor that you
might not recognize the name, but we guarantee
that you will recognize his work.
<p>
Also KitBuilders would like to welcome back
Joe Jobe to the magazine. (Horizon's SIL article
&amp; Vinyl Vignette.) Now we know that some readers
have conflicting views with Joe and visa
versa, but we can all agree that Joe does outstanding
work and it would be a shame not to see
it. ENJOY!!
<p>
PS: Way in the back see this issues
&quot;Recreating Movie Memories&quot; by Ron
McPherson.
<p>
PSS: Contrary to a rumor we heard, Gordy
Dutt WAS NOT the drunk guy that was carried
out of the hotel bar at the last Chiller Theatre
show.
<p>
SPECIAL NOTE: It was not mentioned in
issue #15 that Louis Vasquez sculpted the
&quot;Deadman&quot; kit that was pictured on the cover.
Our apologies.
