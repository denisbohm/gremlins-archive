A WORD FROM THE EDITOR
<p>
Howdy!
<br>
What's in a name?
Welcome to issue number
two of &quot;KIT BUILDERS
AND GLUE SNIFFERS&quot;.
Again, I speak about
the title. A few
readers wrote in dissatisfied
with the magazines
name. WHAT SAY
YOU OTHER READERS? Is
it inappropriate, or
interesting; embarrassing,
or entertaining?
Perhaps you don't care
what it is called, as
long as the contents
interest you. I must
say,&quot;it is a title
that you remember.&quot;
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
<center>(Also)</center>
Due to the time and
money involved in putting
out a magazine of
this type, I must make
a few changes.
<p>
When first conceived,
the magazine was to
come out six (6) times
a year, (A book every
two months.) at twenty
(20) pages a book. (The
1st issue was larger
because it was a premier
issue.) Business
demands, and the schedules
of others associated
with the input
of articles makes this
initial plan very hard.
The quality and content
of the magazine would
suffer.
<p>
So, starting with the
THIRD ISSUE, I will be
combining two issues in
one. So to speak. It
will be a Sixty(60)-plus
page magazine every
four (4) months. A years
subscription will remain
$15.00. A single
copy will be $6.00.
(Outside the U.S.,the
price will be $30.00 a
year, $10.00 a single
copy.)
<p>
Advertising rates will
remain the same for now.
Full page Ad. $50.00,
half page Ad. $25.00. A
quarter page Ad. is
$15.00. Classifieds are
10¢ a word.
<p>
This way we will be
able to produce a
better constructed and
informative magazine.
<p>
If you have any questions,
or comments,
please feel free to
call or write.
<p>
THANK YOU !
<p>
GORDY!!!
