Do you fondly remember all the monsters in your favorite
Science Fiction and Horror movies?  Have you ever longed
to build a model of the evil aliens from Invasion of the
Saucermen or the creature creations of master animator Ray
Harryhausen?   Well, thanks to modern molding and casting
materials and a group of industrious individuals from all
corners of the world, there are kits available of more
aliens, monsters and creatures than you may have ever
imagined!
<p>
Garage Kits were essentially resin castings of sculptures
created and molded in the garages or basements of talented
fans of Science Fiction and Horror films.  However, in
recent years Garage Kits have gone from being an interesting
modeling phenomenon to a full-fledged industry with companies
like Horizon, Screamin' and Geometric producing an astounding
array of subjects in resin and vinyl.  Today, the term Garage
Kit encompasses everything from high-quality kits from large
manufacturers to the individually produced, very limited
edition resin kits from the guy down the street.  Often it
will be the individual producer that provides the more
obscure and interesting characters.
<p>
I'll be covering the pitfalls and pleasures of those kits
produced by amateurs because of their interest in their
subjects, rather than for the money they can make.  Although
the accuracy or quality of these kits may be slightly
lacking, the challenge and anticipation of crafting that
creature that haunted your childhood dreams can go a long
way in overcoming these distractions.  Of course, this will
be a &quot;worst case scenario&quot; with many different problems
cropping up in one kit.  Most kits are not quite this
challenging, but it's best to know everything you might
face and be prepared to correct it.
<p>
<h2>Kit Preparation</h2>
While the large manufacturers of vinyl and resin kits have
become experts in quality control, the small, home based
kit producers can offer product that varies widely in
quality from creator to creator and even from kit to kit.
It pays to inspect any kit you plan on buying very
carefully, since the quality of the casting will not
only affect your final piece, but how much time you will
spend in correcting flaws and details.  However,
inspection isn't always an option since many kits are
only available by mail.  Many garage kits don't come in
nice boxes with interesting art either, they have been
known to come in a plastic bag with no instruction sheet
and it's up to you to figure out how all the parts go
together.  So, a bit of knowledge about your subject
and some modeling knowledge will come in handy.

<h2>Cleaning up</h2>
The best way to start your project is with a bath.  Using
a mild soap and warm water, carefully wash off all parts
to eliminate any mold release agent (and there could be
quite a bit).  Handle thin, fragile looking parts with
extreme care since the resin can be brittle and break
easily.  Because of the manual nature of casting garage
kits, there can be excessive amounts of flash, but be
careful in removing it.  Sometimes it can be difficult
to distinguish between what is flash and what is
intended to be detail.  This is where knowledge of your
subject will serve you well.

flaws can also be caused by a casting<br>

</td></tr>
</table></center>
<p>
Another problem that plagues resin cast garage kits is
pinholes. Pinholes are caused by air bubbles trapped
in the resin during the casting process. Depending
upon the quality of the casting and the resin used,
there can be an apparently overwhelming number of
pinholes to be filled in a given kit.  A favorite
method of filling them is to use drops of gap filling
super glue.  A simple applicator can be made with a
sewing needle and a piece of dowel for a handle.
Using wire cutters, snip the needle's eye in half
(be sure to use eye protection since bits of needle
will be flying) and glue the sharp end of the needle
into a small hole drilled into a 1/4&quot; piece of dowel.
You will have a &quot;U&quot; shaped applicator that will pick
up tiny drops of super glue and deposit them exactly
where you want them.  Because the glue hardens after
a couple of applications, the needle eye needs to be
scraped clean frequently.  This method works best
where there are only a few, larger pinholes to be
filled.  In a case where there are many small holes,
I prefer to use Squadron White modeling putty that
has been diluted 50/50 with lacquer thinner.  By
placing a bit of  putty into a 35mm film container
and adding lacquer thinner in small amounts, you can
reduce the putty to a batter-like consistency and
apply it with a brush.  Using the thinned putty can
cover larger areas of small flaws quickly.  Since
the putty is thinned, it tends to flow into the flaws
and it doesn't clog detail as much as using undiluted
putty. You can even smooth out the putty by lightly
brushing over it with clear lacquer thinner, but be
careful, lacquer thinner can affect the plastic.
Often, if the pinholes are quite small, a good coat
of primer will cover them nicely.

<p>
Air trapped in a resin casting can cause other
problems that don't become visible until you
begin to sand rough areas.  Bubbles that were
below the surface of the resin as it hardened
cause a honeycomb effect beneath the skin of
your model.  Sanding can often reveal these flaws
which are easily repaired with thinned putty. Many
times you can spot these problem areas before
sanding by holding parts up in front of a bright
light and looking for thin spots.  If the depth
of the flaw is too great, you can clean out the
honeycomb with a motor tool and fill the resulting
hole with Milliput A+B epoxy putty.  Using Milliput
will also give you a chance to resculpt any surface
detail that was lost.
<p>
Reference materials play an important part in this
pre-assembly stage as well.  Although most garage
kits build up into good representations of their
subjects, there are often some details missing.  If
complete or at least near complete accuracy is
important to you, then back issues of Science Fiction
and Monster movie magazines will become an important
part of your modeling reference library.

<h2>Assembly</h2>
More than with most standard kits, dry fitting parts
on a garage kit is essential.  You will often find
that surfaces that are supposed to mate, don't exactly
match.  You will have to sand and shape mating surfaces
to match each other.  This is a result of the
&quot;non-professional&quot; nature of the casting process in
garage kits.  Most casters do their absolute best to
deliver an accurate kit, but every part doesn't always
match up.  Test fitting and shaping are the best way
to assure proper fit.

</td></tr>
</table></center>
<p>
Since most mating surfaces are smooth and without
male/female locators, pinning parts together for
strength is another important part of assembly.  The
trick to pinning accurately is finding the center of
both parts in order to locate the pins.  After you
have shaped both mating surfaces so they match up to
your satisfaction, draw an &quot;X&quot; on the mating surface
of one of the parts.  Be sure that the &quot;X&quot; overlaps
the mating surface so you can see its outer legs when
the parts are placed together.  When you place the two
parts together, mark the location of the legs on the
second part.  Now you have reference markings to make
a second &quot;X&quot; on the mating surface of the that part.
When you drill holes at the center of the two &quot;Xs&quot;,
the holes should line up with each other.  Using super
glue, affix a small piece of wire (a piece of paper
clip works well here) into one hole.  After it is dry
and secure, test fit again before finally gluing the
part in place.
<p>
Of course, super glue is an absolute necessity for
assembling any resin kit, but 5 minute epoxy can come
in handy for attaching parts that still have gaps
even after all the sanding and shaping is done.  The
epoxy helps to fill the gaps from within and provides
a strong joint.  Any remaining gaps can be handled
with gap filling super glue or model putty.  However
if the surface you're filling needs detailing to
match surrounding areas, Milliput Epoxy Putty becomes
indispensable.  As the two-part putty sets up, you
can detail it and blend the edges into a seamless
surface.  It also comes in handy for replacing
details that have been lost in casting or filling
the larger holes caused by large bubbles in the resin.
Milliput is very user friendly, it is easily worked
and smoothed with water and it holds detail well.

<p>
Naturally, all these problems won't appear in every
kit and as casting materials and techniques improve,
so will the quality of these small-run kits.  Once
you've assembled your garage kit, you're ready to
move on to the most rewarding part of the process,
the painting.
<p>
<h2>Painting</h2>
Resin kits accept nearly any kind of paint you'd use
on a styrene kit; enamels, acrylics, lacquers or
oils, or any combination.  On the other hand, vinyl
kits can be very picky about paint and it's best to
stick with the water-based acrylics since enamels
and oils won't fully dry on a vinyl surface.  Once
your figure is primed, you can test nearly every
painting technique you know.  A monster's surface
practically cries out for washes, dry brushing,
blending and shading or any other tricks you can
think of.  It's all up to you.

<p>
<h2>Bases and Dioramas</h2>
Although there is a new trend toward including
&quot;Aurora&quot; style bases in recent garage kits, many
kits come as &quot;stand alone&quot; figures.  Depending
upon how much space you have to display your
creations, you may want to create your own base
or create a diorama to show off your creature.
Bases can range from a simple stained wooden
plaque to a landscaped, themed base that reflects
your creation's environment.  Of course, dioramas
for these creatures will let your imagination run
wild.
