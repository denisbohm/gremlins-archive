to all the Gremlins out there!  I have to say that I am 
very excited to have accidentally broken in the exciting field of the 
manufacture of garage kits.  I have been sculpting original fantasy 
figures for a number of years now, but until recently it hadn't occured 
to me to try to reproduce and market any of them.  I'm not even sure if I 
could.  The pieces I do are made for relatives and special people in my 
life, and each one is very personal.  But many people have encouraged me 
to make some that I could sell, and what with the introduction I am 
getting to casting in resin, which I find very interesting, I might very 
well do just that.

<p>
The main source for my current inspiration is an article by Mike 
James in the latest issue of Kit Builders Magazine, in which he details 
the construction and casting of his most recent and remarkable piece, 
Angelissa, an angel and sister to Sedusa (both of which are originals and 
licensed by Mike).  What struck me as I eagerly poured over the article 
was the similarity between his sculpting process and mine.  All this 
time, I thought what I was doing was just the best an amateur could do 
with a hobby that engaged him, and here I find a well known professional 
using the very same methods and materials and creating some wonderful and 
marketable pieces.

<p>
To make a long story short(er), I contacted Mike James of Azimuth 
Design in New York, and he supplied me with a lot of useful information 
on casting, and put me onto the Gremlin Net.  As a result, now having 
&quot;met&quot; Denis Bohm, and talking to him about my interests, and on his 
encouragement, I am writing this article on the sculpting of an original 
piece from Super Sculpey, including what will hopefully be useful 
information for all of you out there who may have been interested in 
doing an original of your own, but may not be quite sure of how to go 
about it.  I won't include anything on casting, as that is too new to me, 
and there are probably many of you who already know how that is done, or 
know of a production house that would cast your piece for you.  And if you 
haven't checked out Mike's article in KB, please do so, you will find it 
very informative.  And while you might find his skill and final product 
rather daunting, remember, we all start somewhere and sometime, and here 
and now would be a great place for you to start.

<p>
Here we go.  There are two basic approaches I have used, and I'll 
address them both as best I can, hoping one or the other will work for 
you.  The first involves a concept for a figure that you have pictured in 
your imagination very clearly.  If you are handy with a pencil, start 
making rough drawings to work out the details and give yourself a sort of 
blueprint or plan to follow, something to keep you on track.  Or if your 
inspiration comes from a photograph or comic or someone else's work, you 
already have a pretty concrete plan right there in front of you.  Of 
course, please respect any copyrights or licenses that the original 
artist might have.

<p>
If your blueprint is clear enough, you may be able to construct an 
armature right from the measurements you take off the picture.  If the 
drawing is not quite of the right scale, just take it to the ol' Xerox 
amd reduce or enlarge it to whatever size you want.  If you can't draw, 
then skip this step.  It is helpful, but not necessary.

<p>
For those of you who are new to this, an armature is anything around 
which you place the clay that supports the work and helps define it.
For the purposes of constructing a figure, the armature is a frame or 
&quot;skeleton&quot; usually made of wire that will serve as the guide for the pose 
and its internal support.  Don't even try a piece of any reasonable size 
without one.  You will pay in frustration later for any short cut you try 
to take at this stage.

<p>
The size of the wire, or guage, will depend on the size of the piece 
for the most part.  For a piece that is approximately 1/6 scale, I find 
that a wire around 1/8 inch, more or less, works well.  It is workable, 
and will hold a pose easily, while also allowing for adjustments along 
the way as you continue to work on the figure.

<p>
You can all draw a stick figure, just make one out of the wire.  
Don't worry about the pose until the proportions are correct.  Again, 
check them against your drawing or picture, or just use your own eye.  If 
is looks about right, it probably is.  And if you are doing a monster or 
some sort of fantasy creature, you almost can't go wrong as far as 
proportions go.  Use smaller wire to bind the arms and legs to the torso, 
or use one long piece to make the arm-body-leg section of one side, then 
make a matching one for the other side.  Bind these two together, then 
make a small looped piece for the head, leaving a long &quot;neck&quot; on it that 
you can then bind to the torso.  I find this allows me to adjust that 
always difficult neck length.  Also, leave plenty of extra wire coming 
out past where you think the hands and feet will be - you can always cut 
it off later, and extra wire at the feet will allow you to bury it in a 
base, should you decide to add one later.  If you are not using a base, 
you can at least stick the extra wire down into a shoebox lid, so you can 
stand the figure up there while you are not working on it, rather than 
laying it down and smashing your hard work.

<p>
Often then I will wrap the armature with aluminum foil, squeezing 
and twisting it around the wire.  This gives the Sculpey something to 
hold on to, and adding more foil, building up the torso, hips, head, and 
upper legs and arms a little will allow you to use less clay and help you 
begin to see the figure a bit more clearly.

<p>
I have made free-standing pieces and ones that were on a base, and 
this is the point where this decision should be made.  Free-standing 
figures need to be balanced carefully in the pose, while ones on a base 
can be at nearly impossible angles - up on one foot, leaning into a fast 
run, or even &quot;flying&quot;, apparently free, at first glance, of the base 
altogether.  Even if the piece will eventually be free-standing, you can 
extend the leg wires well past the feet, secure them to a temporary base, 
then you will be able to work the piece without having to constantly be 
careful about how you handle the body.  You will remove this base after 
the piece is cooked.

<p>
While adjusting the pose, use one of your best resources... yourself.
(Or another willing subject).  Investigate your own body mechanics.
How far up your chest does your knee come when you bend it?
About to the shoulder?  Bend your arm at the elbow and touch your 
shoulder, noting the length of your upper and lower arm, and how your 
hand fits into the triangle there.  Where does your elbow touch your 
waist?  What's the relationship of the length of your upper leg to the 
length of your lower arm from elbow to the tip of your extended fingers?  
Have you ever noticed that your foot is about the length of the inside of 
your forearm?  How wide are your shoulders compared to your forearm?  
Measure everything.  You may get some weird looks while doing 
this, but your body is the best teacher of anatomy that you have.
Spend some time with it.

<p>
So... all posed now and ready for the clay.  I use Super Sculpey.  
This is a sculpting compound, relatively inexpensive (between $7 and $9 
for a one-pound box), that is available in most of your local hobby or 
craft stores, and it cooks in your home oven at 275 degrees, so you don't 
need a special oven or anything like that.  You may notice a slight odor 
as it cooks - this is no big deal.  And unless you over-cook it, it won't 
change colors either.  The instructions say to cook it 15 minutes for 
each quarter inch of thickness, but if I had followed this, I would have 
burned some of the pieces I've made right to the ground.  I 
usually start with 20 minutes, then check how the surface of the clay 
feels every 5 minutes or so.  Super Sculpey, before it's cooked, feels 
sort of moist and rubbery, and then changes to a distinctly dry feel like 
unglazed ceramic after it's cooked.  Even when it's finished it will feel 
a little flexible while it's still hot, but will become rigid when it 
cools.  It's just going to take some time to learn, but this product is 
pretty forgiving.  Regular Sculpey, the white kind, burns and smokes a 
bit, and will bubble up easily if you are not very careful about not 
trapping air under the layers.  I have never had this problem with Super 
Sculpey.  I have never tried Sculpey III.

<p>
I actually have a number of tools, but the one I use the most, aside 
from the ones I am using to write this, is this little metal cuticle 
thing I stole from my wife's nail polish basket.  It is about three 
inches long, with one end kind of arrow-head shaped, while the other end 
flattens out into a sort of little rectangular spade.  Every once in a 
great while, I will pick up a dental tool, but for what I use it for, a 
toothpick would work just as well.

<p>
Super Sculpey is roughly an acceptable human caucasian flesh tone, 
and will actually, once cooked and sanded and buffed, give you a very 
nice, deep, naturally alive looking skin.  Most of you will pobably be
painting, so the finish will not matter that much.  If you will not be 
painting however, here's an important hint: Keep Your Hands Clean!  The 
Sculpey will pick up dirt and oil from your hands and fingers, and you 
will not be able to get it out later.

<p>
Begin applying the Sculpey, in small amounts, all over the 
armature.  Take care to press the clay well onto the wire or foil, and 
smooth and blend the small lumps into each other, trying to eliminate any 
gaps and cracks between them.  Apply it over the entire armature evenly.  
This will also help you to begin to see the shape better, and you can 
make adjustments as you go.  It is NEVER too late to make adjustments in 
the pose, even after the piece is cooked.  If you want, you can lop off 
an arm or leg to change the position, cut the neck to turn or tip the 
head, saw through the waist to adjust the turn of the shoulders and hips, 
whatever.  There are any number of model fillers that can cover joints 
and gaps, and with a little sand paper, you can make a mistake look like 
you planned it that way.

<p>
Remember, at this point you aren't going for a human (or monstrous) 
shape, you are just filling out the armature.  Once it's done, you can 
either cook it as it is, giving you a more stable frame, or proceed to 
add even more clay.  I have done it both ways, and for me they work 
equally well.  The advantage to Sculpey is that you can add to it and 
cook it more, as long as you don't over do it.  It also is pretty 
user-friendly in that you can work it for several days, and it won't dry 
out and crack, as long as the frame is strong enough to support the 
weight of the clay.  I keep pieces I'm working on covered with a plactic 
grocery bag just to keep dust off them.

<p>
One thing that works for me while I am doing a piece is to work it 
fairly evenly all over, not letting one part get highly detailed before 
the others are halfway done.  This is because the proportions need to 
work together, and it is also easier for your eye to follow the growth of 
the piece if that development is even and gradual, rather than having one 
beautifully finished leg on a skeleton body.  However, some people can 
work this way, and I say more power to them.  Find out what works for you.

<p>
Another tip, keep turning the piece, working at it from all sides at 
the same time.  Many people have some difficulty seeing the entirety of a 
three-dimensional mass all at once, but most can see an outline or 
profile much more easily.  If you keep shaping the profiles, and keep 
turning the piece, you will find that before long you can see more and 
more of the three-dimensional mass, and you haven't really tried to 
sculpt it.

<p>
Also, don't be cautious.  Think about it; what's the worst that can 
happen if all of a sudden you find you've made the head too big, or the 
nose is in the wrong place?  Nothing.  Most of you will probably be 
sculpting monsters anyway, so who cares?  For those of you that will be 
doing human, you still don't need to be particularly careful until the 
end, and remember, mistakes are easy to fix.  For those of you who, like 
myself, are sculpting the female form, you will need to take more care, 
but really only in the final phases.  So get some clay on there, push it 
around, find out what it will and will not do.  And just in case you're 
wondering, it will do just about anything, once you really get to know it.

<p>
One of the greatest contemporary sculptors I know, Bruno Lucchesi, 
says this about sculpting, &quot;If you can see, you can do.&quot;  Step back from 
your piece frequently, walk around it, turn it upside down, whatever.  
Look at it from as many angles as you can.  You have been looking at the 
human form for many years now, just keep comparing those images with the 
one you see developing in front of you.  Mr. Lucchesi's point is that 
your eye is probably your most valuable tool.  Take your time, breathe, 
take a lot of breaks, and if you don't feel like working, stop.  Coming 
back later will give you a fresh perspective.

<p>
Don't feel that you have to know a great deal about human anatomy 
before you get started.  You will learn about that as you go along, and 
you probably know more about it than you think.  The main thing is to 
just get started, and enjoy yourself.  Another thing, no matter how much 
you do this sort of thing, no piece will ever turn out exactly like you 
envisioned it.  You will forever be frustrated if you try to see the 
piece in front of you for what it &quot;should be&quot;, but you may be pleasantly 
surprised if you let yourself see the piece for what it is.

<p>
Try to simplify shapes as you begin.  Arms and legs are basically 
cylinders, slightly tapered.  Work in the pinches and bulges later.  
Head - a ball or egg shape.  Hips - a rectangular prism, rounded out later.  
Mid-section - another cylinder, very short and wide, perhaps flattened out 
from the front to the back.  Upper torso - another rectangular prism, 
bigger than the hip one, and maybe a littler larger at the top.  
Neck - another cylinder.  Feet - small triangular prisms laying on their 
sides (not on the triangular side).  Hands - flattened out cubes or 
rectangles, with cylinder fingers attached.

<p>
Now, if you stick to that and put all those pieces together, you 
will end up with something that looks like a big, chunky robot.  Cool!  
What's wrong with that?  It might actually be a lot of fun for a first 
project.  Do it, cook it, then you'll have something to point at and say 
&quot;Yeah, I sculpted that!&quot;  It might be rough, but at least you've 
started.  If you want, you can certainly round out the shapes and blend 
them before you cook the piece, or grab the whole thing with both hands, 
give it a squeeze, letting it squish out between your fingers, then cook 
that and you'll end up with some kind of mutant thing or other that you 
couldn't have imagined even if you tried!  Have fun. The ultimate details 
depend on the gender of the piece, how realistic or fantastic it is, and 
mostly, what looks good to you.  Some details require more attention than 
others, and every sculptor has some area that always challenges them.  
Try to avoid copying someone else's piece, or you will always be 
measuring your success against how someone else has defined it.  Discover 
and develop your own style, do what pleases you.  And observe, observe, 
observe.  

<p>
When I started this article, I mentioned two basic methods that have 
worked for me.  All the information above applies to both methods, the 
only difference in the second one is the armature.  Instead of making the 
wire skeleton, I take a sheet of foil and tear it part way up from one 
end to about the middle, then make a tear in form each side, up near the 
top edge, about a third of the way in.  Then I squeeze these areas into 
skinny arms and legs, and just sort of mash the middle part into a 
torso.  For the head, I make a ball out of foil and stick it on a piece 
of wire, which I push down into the torso.  Now I just start to play with 
the pose, letting the armature tell me what it wants to be, and I 
continue this approach even well into the application of the clay.  The 
piece speaks to me as I work it, and I notice a definate personality the 
more time I spend.  It should be noted that this is a much more 
subjective approach, and works best for smaller pieces.  Usually I mix 
the two methods, but it's sort of neat to start a piece without a firm 
idea of what it will look like when it is finished.

<p>
The main thing I've been trying to do is to encourage you to give
this sculpting thing a shot.  Ultimately, there is no one way 
to do this.  Everyone finds what works best for them.  The only 
difference is that some of us have started, and some haven't yet.  So what 
are you waiting for?
