<h2>Japan Wonderfest 94: Photo Tour</h2>

<img src="../garage/letter/i.gif" alt="I" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="29">
attended the Japanese Modeling Convention Wonder Festival while
I was in Tokyo, Japan on August 21st of 1994. I took about 200
pictures of the models there. Here is a quick writeup of the
convention, and an index of the pictures I took there.
<p>
<dl><dd><b>
Wonder Festival, Summer 94<br>
Sunday, August 21, 1994<br>
Tokyo, Chuo Ku, Harumi<br>
</b>
<font size="-1"><i>(Just outside Tokyo, Japan, Southeast of the Ginza district)</i></font>
</dl>
<p>
The show started at 10:30 am and closed at 5:00 pm.
The admission price was 1500 yen (about $16) which includes a
96 page Guide Book.
There were about 485 dealers listed in the Guide book, with 85
listed as Pro Dealers and 400 listed as Amateur Dealers.
About two thirds of the dealers were model kit dealers, but about
a third were toy dealers.
<p>
I would guess that over 50 percent of the figure kit dealers were
small, independent dealers, with about the same percent of the
models being non-pro models. As such, the kits may not be
available outside Japan. Many of the models were show specials,
available only at the show, and are no longer available. A lot of
the models were original designs, not based on any other
character designs.
<p>
You may notice that a lot of the pictures are of girl figures.
This accurately represents the percentage of female figure kits
at the convention. Over 70 percent of the models at the
convention were of females, with a low percent of robot models
and monsters, and an even smaller percent of male figures of any
type.
<p>
I only made one pass through the dealer's room with my camera,
and missed a lot of the models. I would say that I only got
pictures of about 50 percent of the models there, maybe even
less. In all, I got pictures of over 100 models.
<p>
Many of the kits I photographed were original models, done by
independent amateur modelers. So, there are a lot of the pictures
that neither my friends nor I could identify. Also, there were so
many small dealers that we could not even identify the maker of a
lot of the kits. I wrote as much information as I was able to
find on each photo. In the following list, I used a figure of
$1.00 to 100 yen for the prices.

<p>
Here are some technical details of how the pictures were
produced. The pictures were taken with a Cannon A1 SLR camera
with a Vivitar 35-105MM 1:3.5 Zoom Lens with Macro, and a Vivitar
285 flash with inflatable 6&quot;x8&quot; Flash Soft Box diffuser on the
front. The flash unit was mounted on the hotshoe on the top of
the camera during shooting. The film used was Kodak Royal Gold
400 speed print film. Through experimentation on several rolls of
film, it was determined that the best depth of field tradeoff was
obtained with an aperture of F8 or F11, with the flash unit set
to a manual setting of 1/16 power. I took two pictures of each
model, using both apertures. The film was processed and
transferred to Photo-CD pictures through my local photo dealer,
using Kodalux processing labs. The cost was $3 per roll for
processing and $0.79 per image transferred. This resulted in 151
images (4 rolls of film) on one Photo CD (number 0416) and 36
images on a second Photo CD (number 0634).

<p>
All the files are JPEG files converted from the Photo CD files.
They were cropped and reduced from the original Photo CD
resolution of 2048x3072 to fit on a 640x480 screen.
Those pictures with any adult content at all are labeled ADULT.
