<img src="../garage/letter/w.gif" alt="W" WIDTH="37" HEIGHT="30">onderfest '96 has come and gone, and what a show it was!  When the
show's guest of honor, Ray Harryhausen was announced some months ago, there
was little doubt that the show would draw more than the usual number of
attendees.  Still, I was totally unprepared for the crowds milling about on
the opening day of the show!  A change of venue from the traditional site
was certainly warranted because the show was easily twice as large as it
had been in previous years.

<p>
<a href="wf96_10.jpg"><img src="wf96_10i.jpg" alt="wf96_10.jpg" width="168" height="164" align="left" border="1"></a>
I'll get to the vendor room and contest in just a bit, but I also wanted
to mention some of the other items of interest at the show.  There was
little question who many folks came to see, Ray Harryhausen.  Long lines
formed well before each of his signing sessions.  The model contest was
also a testament to the fondness and well wishes that many have for the
special effects pioneer.  Sinbad, Jason and the Argonauts, the Ymir, and
other kits abounded.

<p>
Aliens/Predator and Star Wars artist Dave Dorman's appearance was a
special treat for me.  I was delighted to have a chance to talk with him
and get his autograph along with a cool Alien sketch in my copy of Aliens:
Tribes.  Other special guests included regulars Bob Burns, Chris Walas, and
Dave Cockrum.  Nestor the Wonderfestor also made a special appearance at
the awards ceremony to pass out prizes and generally make fun of Bob Burns.

<p>
Prizes for the annual charity auction were also turbocharged for this
year's show.  Raffle tickets could be purchased for a chance to win Walas
Fly maquettes as well as original props from Naked Lunch and Gremlins.
(Sorry Denis, I tried!)

<p>
There were so many vendors and kits at the show, that it's tough to
mention (let alone remember) all of them!  Here are some standouts in my
mind:

<p>
Janus was on hand featuring their new Hunchback of Notre Dame kit.  If
you loved their Lon Chaney kit as much as me, then the Hunchback is a
no-brainer!  This beautifully sculpted piece is designed to hang on your
wall.  A great solution to dwindling shelf space!  Janus was also showing
off their gorgeous  Lugosi White Zombie kit by Kuntz, a terrific Karloff
Mummy in a sarcophogus, and some busts.  White Zombie should be available
before the Fall Chiller show.

<p>
In addition to their current stable of vinyl kits, GEOmetric was showing
a new vinyl Kong produced by Max Factory, the re-released Pumpkinhead 1,
and the first of many (I hope) imports from Max Factory, the Takeya
Devilman.  They were also showing some beautiful 1:4 busts of Pumpkinhead
and Max Schreck as the Nosferatu.

<p>
Grey Zone had a wild display of their skulls.  New offerings include
their Alien Queen and Godzilla skulls along with a petrified Gillman hand.
A real eye popper had to be the 1:1 face hugger (cast from an original
prop) that was floating in a specimum cylinder.  I'm sure Luis got sick of
telling people the cylinder wasn't for sale.  My wife will not rest until I
have built one now!  Other surprises from Grey Zone included the first of
their new figure kits, 1:6 castings of a young and vigorous Yoda (!)
wielding a sabre and a lumbering Gomorrean guard from Return of the Jedi.

<p>
Mad Labs was present with Mike Park's wonderful Tiny Terrors.  New
additions included a rocket propelled Robocop on a pogo stick, and a
gorilla loaded down with weaponry.  Mike's continuing to beef up his line
with small pieces to spice up your shelves or dioramas.  I'd really like to
see him do some more realistic 1:4 scale busts though.

<p>
<a href="wf96_8.jpg"><img src="wf96_8i.jpg" alt="wf96_8.jpg" width="168" height="164" align="left" border="1"></a>
Jim Groman was on hand with stacks of his Beach Blanket Beastie along
with his new Conglomeron kit.  The Conglomeron follows the tried and true
&quot;half-naked woman being carted away by an ugly monster&quot; motif.  Here, the
monster is an ugly patchwork monster comprised of MANY different animals.
Really bizarre.  Of the two, I think the Beastie is the stronger kit.

<p>
I was pleasantly surprised to find Cellar Cast on hand to show their
Boris pieces.  I spoke with Melinda and Steve about the next Boris piece
(due in August).  It features a towering demon with his wings wrapped
around a nude woman.  Beautiful!  Their new &quot;shattered wall&quot; base was also
quite impressive, and I was quick to tack on an order for one w/ my
retailer who was updating his standing orders at the booth.

<p>
<a href="wf96_3.jpg"><img src="wf96_3i.jpg" alt="wf96_3.jpg" width="168" height="164" align="left" border="1"></a>
Terry Fitton from Monsters in Motion was showing off his company's ever
growing collection of original kits.  It's no surprise that there were MANY
Harryhausen kits to choose from.  The Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein, Dr.
Praetorius, and Peter Cushing as Dr. Van Helsing kits were also available,
as was their new Secret Agenda kit.  Fans of Dark Horse's &quot;.38 Special&quot;
will go crazy over Secret Agenda.

<p>
The ever irrepressible Jimmy Flintstone was showing off his large
selection of resin car conversion kits, figures, and new Testor's slammer
kits.  It looks like he may be doing more larger scale figures like his
Vampiress kit (or as Lance calls it, the &quot;stick licker&quot;).  The sculpting
quality may be a bit on the coarse side, but his kits are still a good
value for the money IMO.

<p>
<a href="wf96_9.jpg"><img src="wf96_9i.jpg" alt="wf96_9.jpg" width="168" height="164" align="left" border="1"></a>
Speaking of irrepressible casters, Kevin Stephens of Shadow Castings was
on hand to debut his newest kits.  Fans of the classic Weird-Oh's car kits
will love &quot;Ungrateful Dead&quot; and &quot;Zombie Beach Party.&quot;  &quot;Dead&quot; features a
coffin-like dragster peeling across a drawbridge and leaving a trail of
smokey skulls behind.  At the wheel is none other than the Grim Reaper,
lovin' death and hell bent for chaos.  &quot;Zombie&quot; takes a slightly different
tack on the same subject, and features a hearse STUFFED full of fun-lovin'
zombies.  These kits must weigh in at 10-15 lbs, feature MANY resin and
white metal parts, and include poster sized Shadow Casting-styled
instruction sheets.

<p>
Puff n' Stuff were present with STACKS of American and Japanese garage
kits.  I was sorely tempted by the 1:1 Clive Barker &quot;Yattering&quot; kits they
were showing.  They had some terrific Volks kits available.  (Yes, the
Soryama stuff went QUICKLY.)  Kaiju fans could go nuts here and at adjacent
booths that were loaded to the gills with Gojira and Gamera kits.  Godzilla
vs. Destroyah kits and toys were in abundance.

<p>
<a href="wf96_1.jpg"><img src="wf96_1i.jpg" alt="wf96_1.jpg" width="168" height="164" align="left" border="1"></a>
Alternative Images were showing off some of their new pieces.  Standouts
included a female Nosferatu, a Wizard of Oz witch w/ Monkey, and the piece
de resistance, a 1:4 Army of Darkness flying demoness DIORAMA.  For a mere
$400, you too can own a kit of the demoness flying away whilst reading from
her fave book.  Her wingspan was on the order of 25&quot; wide, and the castle
walls were larger still.  A very cool sculpture, but this kit has pushed
WAY beyond the range of reasonable kit sizes.

<p>
Action Kits International and Shape of Things were tag teaming at their
adjacent tables.  Matt McWhirt was selling his X-Files-inspired &quot;aliens in
a jar&quot; like they were going out of style.  Action Kit's Masque of the Red
Death was on display, and looked beautiful.  If you're interested in this
one, I'd jump on it quickly!  I didn't get a chance to ask Mike and Matt if
they were still in the green for recasting the Curse of Sekenen-Rah.

<p>
Action Hobbies of Louisville were showing off their ever growing
collection of Mars Attacks kits and &quot;Aurora kits that never made it.&quot;
Their resin Mars kits are quite cool, and should please fans of the genre
that haven't got their fill from Screamin's offerings.  Their &quot;Phaedra&quot; kit
designed by Dave Cockrum and sculpted by Jim Fawkes remains a personal
favorite.  I recommend it to folks looking for a reasonably priced kit of a
futuristic female.

<p>
In addition to presenting the seminar on sculpting, Raven Hood was
selling his Heavy Metal Taarna and Holly Wood kits.  He also had a really
nice kit that looked a bit like Harley Quinn.  While Raven's sculpting
style isn't exactly to my taste, I know a lot of folks appreciate his
outstanding work.  If you're a fan of his stuff, you'll want to be sure to
check out the harlequin!

<p>
Terry Webb and David Fisher were as often gone as not from their table.
No doubt conducting interviews or giving seminars.  Interestingly, copies
of Terry's old books were available for sale, as were back issues of AFM.
I could've kicked myself for not immediately grabbing a copy of AFM #0 as
soon as I hit the dealer room.  Live and learn.

<p>
That's a brief rundown of most of the garage kit retailers and vendors
that were on hand.  Of course there were MANY other dealers selling kits
and toys.  I don't think many anime kit fans went away disappointed this
year.  That genre seems to be better represented at the dealer tables each
year.  I know my wife was delighted to walk away w/ a Belldandy kit that
she's been searching for for a while!

<p>
Another surprise related to the vendor tables IMO, was the availability
and affordability of BUILD UPS.  It's not at all uncommon to find old
Aurora kit build ups at the tables, but I was witness to a rather strange
phenomenon this time around - painted garage kit build ups available at or
near their original prices.  Weird!  My wife walked with a Kaiyodo Mina and
Dracula for around $15 more than I'd seen them listed at.  A similar
example was a really nice Dark Horse Predator 1 build up (w/ original box
and instructions) for $300.  Some one else apparently thought it was a good
deal too, because it didn't stick around for very long!  Only time will
tell if this is a new trend...

<p>
What would a model show be without a model contest?  I'm not sure, but
Wonderfest had a contest, so we'll not ponder the question any further.
Last year's contest was proclaimed a &quot;Judge's Nightmare&quot; by several people
I spoke with.  This year's contest had to be a Judge's vision of Hell!  I
can't begin to describe the variety and quality of the kits that were
entered this year.  Since there was a special Ray Harryhausen award to be
given away this year, it's little wonder that MANY of the entries were kits
based on his characters.

<p>
Aliens and Predators, usually in abundance, were few and far between
this year.  Dinos made a comeback after a disappointing turn out last year.
Anime-related kits also made progress this year, as there were more than
I've ever recalled seeing before.  Hopefully organizers will get the hint
that this is a genre that deserves its own category.  I could go on, but
I'd be overlooking many wonderful pieces.  I'm hoping to provide some
photos of show entries to Denis, and I'm sure the magazines will be loaded
with pix and lists of winners in another few months.  (Ah, the joys of
standard print and snail mail!)  I would like to nominate the fellow who
finished the Sideshow Frankenstein kit for the &quot;Hardcore Stud Garage Kit
Builder from Hell (tm)&quot; award for turning that kit out in under a week.
The man could not have slept at all, and the paint job wasn't bad looking!

<p>
I'll hop up on my soapbox for just a moment to complain about the
treatment that nudes received at the show.  This is the first year that
I've seen kits with nudity either turned around or censored in someway.
(One exception was a Reds kit entered by Rick LaRue last year.)  I was
shocked and disgusted to see a post-it note stuck on the front of a .38
Special.  Likewise, the detail work on several Soryama pieces and two
Return of the Living Dead 3 kits couldn't be enjoyed due to censorship.
Strangely, a couple kits (one Silene comes to mind) were ignored in this
regard.  While I can appreciate not wanting to expose minors to lewd or
suggestive works, none of the kits entered were not significantly more lewd
than viewing a nude painted by an old master.  I'll also point out that
children could view Reds' kits featuring erotic females at several vendor
tables.

<p>
The question that remains in my mind now that Wonderfest has closed its
doors for 1996 is &quot;What of next year?&quot;  It's unlikely IMO that Harryhausen
will make another visit next time around.  If, as I suspect, the crowd was
inflated by his visit this year, what will next year be like?  Regardless,
I know one modeler who will be back for more!
