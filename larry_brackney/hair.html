&quot;hair&quot; packaged with garage kits, is really twine or cord of some
kind.  You'll have to unravel it before applying.  Once you have unraveled
a &quot;bunch*&quot; that you'd like to glue down, stretch it out and trim it a
little bit longer than you'd like it to be on the kit.  Hold one end, then
use a needle, comb, or even a small knife blade to separate the strands.
You want to make sure to remove any knots or kinks at this point.  You
should end up with a clump of hair with one end bunched between your
fingers.  You'll be preparing many such clumps, and affixing them as you
go.
<p>
* By &quot;bunch,&quot; I DON'T mean a huge section.  For best results, you should
take it slow, and apply hair in small quantities.  It's a fairly tedious
process, but the results can be terrific!

<p>
Now you're ready to affix a clump of hair to the figure.  I've affixed
hair a couple ways now.  When I did the cryptkeeper, I used rubber cement
to affix the hair.  It was messy, and as long as I took care to lay the
hair down carefully it was not noticeable.  Of course rubber cement is NOT
intended to be a permanent bond and it can/will peal up on you.  As such, I
don't recommend it.

<p>
A better solution is to go buy a bottle of Liquitex Matte Medium at an
art supply store.  This is the same stuff that David Fisher uses to make
glazes, so you'll have an extra use for it if you want to give that
technique (described in AFM #3 and Model Mania v. 2) a try.

<p>
Simply brush some of the medium onto the bunched up end of the hair
clump and onto the head and press the hair in place.  You may have to brush
on a little more medium to get it to stick.  Also, brush away any excess
medium from the surrounding scalp area.  As you apply it, it will look
milky white.  You'll be tempted to groan and say, &quot;I've ruined it!&quot;  Fear
not, it dries clear.  The resulting bond is fairly strong, and will
withstand a SMALL amount of tugging to reposition and trim strands.

<p>
Work your way around the head, laying longer clumps in first.  Think
about how YOUR hair parts along the scalp, and lay the clumps accordingly.
Eventually, place shorter clumps around the ears and forehead.  Take your
time, and give the clumps plenty of time to dry.  You'll want to gently
pull the hair around to find out where you need to put more in.  It's
important to identify thin or bald spots - unless you want them there!

<p>
After you've gotten decent coverage, it's time for a trip to the
barber's!  Yes, garage kits need hair cuts too!  Use a pair of scissors to
trim the hair to the desired length.  I usually call in my wife at this
point to give me styling tips and pointers.  (Yes, even the Cryptkeeper
needs styling!)

<p>
When you are completely happy trimming, adding, or rearranging the hair,
I recommend hitting the whole thing with a light coat of lacquer.  This
will further bond the hair to the scalp.  Make sure to use a VERY light
dusting motion.  You don't want to mat the hair down, nor do you want to
&quot;blow&quot; the hair out of place.  In the case of Dimensional Design's Swamp
Witch, I applied multiple heavy coats of gloss lacquer, since I was after a
wet matted look.
