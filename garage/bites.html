Schlitzie was perhaps the most famous of the Sideshow pinheads at the beginning of the 20th
century.  He suffered from an anomaly called 'microcephaly', a term used to describe an affliction
that reduces the cranial capacity in an individual from the normal average of 1600 cubic centimeters
to an astonishingly low 400 cubic centimeters.  This severe affliction undoubtly affects the mental
capacity of the individual, limiting them to very simply tasks.  Schlitzie, although a male
microcephalic, and much smarter than the average pinhead, was forced to wear a dress because his
guardian stated it was easier to take care of his toilet needs.  Schlitzie charmed audiences
for over 30 years before dying  at the remarkable age of 80.  Schlitzie can be seen today in
Tod Brownings' film masterpiece, Freaks, with other infamous human oddities from the 1930's.

Sculptor Randy Bowen has safely returned from a fact-finding tour on the planet
Tatooine in the Star Wars universe, where he barelyescaped death and dismemberment in
the execution pit of Jabba the Hutt while sculpting the savage Rancor monster for the second
statue in the program of ultra-limited edition Star Wars bronzes from Dark horse comics and
Bowen Designs.
<p>
&quot;I have always tried to bring realism to my work,&quot; Bowen remarked, &quot;but I never thought
it would cost me my skin.  Fortunately, I was able to capture the likeness before it captured me!&quot;
this likeness has been successfully translated into a highly detailed bronze measuring 15&quot;
tall, weighing 25 pounds on its rich base of black Spanish marble.  The edition is strictly
limited to only 50 numbered copies and is being offered at a price of $3,000.00.

<p>
  <b>He Brings Death on a Dark Cloud; and His Name is Vengeance:  Grazetta's Death Dealer Returns!</b>
<p>
In 1994, the undisputed master of fantasy art, Frank Frazetta and premier sculptor Randy
Bowen came together to create a bronze translation of Frazetta's legendary Death Dealer.
Over the years, the silent, brooding character of Frazetta's legendary painting had been
captured on countless publications, posters, art books, magazines, plaques, and scores of
other items.  It has even been adopted by the U.S. Army Tank Corp. as mascot!  Finally,
through this very unique collaboration between these two talented artists and Dark Horse
Comics, a three-dimensional bronze sculpture of the Death Dealer was born.  Limited to
only 50 bronzes, it sold out immediately and is now a coveted collectors' treasure that
commands fantastic prices on the high-end collector's market.
<p>
With special permission granted by the Frazettas, Dark Horse Comics and Bowen Designs
are producing Frank Frazett's Death Dealer as a Cold-cast, limited-edition sculpture.  The
fully painted, meticulously detailed sculpture stands at 13 1/2&quot; high and sits atop a dark
mahogany base and includes burnished steel chains.  Though slightly different, it remains
exacting in every detail, this impressive peice captures the dark mystery and veiled menace
that has captivated fantasy fans and collectors worldwide.
<p>
The Death Dealer is limited to 5,000 copies.  Each statue is individually numbered and
comes in an elegant full-color collector's box.  The Death Dealer will be available December
1997 for a suggested retail price of $250.00.
<p>
To preview this special project, check out the Dark Horse website:  http://www.dhorse.com

<b>You weaklings!</b><br>
<p>
October 31st, 1997.  In a recent press conference, Doctor Howard Phillips of the
Spring Grove Mental Hospital issued a statement in which he declared noted
sculptor Randy Bowen legally insane.  The statement came just after Bowen
attempted to prove to the world that the ancient legend of &quot;the Jimmy Leggs&quot; did,
in fact, exist, and that his Great Grandfather had borne witness to the strange
ritual in which the beast was summoned.  Shortly after demanding a search party
be formed, Bowen ordered his now world famous company, Bowen Designs, to release
a fully detailed and meticulously - sculpted version of The Jimmy Leggs,
complete with base and a sculpted version of the &quot;Woman from the Stars&quot; - who
he claimes is the monster's keeper.  He has made the sculpture available in two
versions:  1000 will be produced as a pre-painted sculpture, and 500 will be
unassembled model kits.<br>
The second in a series of original creations, both model and statue will include a
detailed account of Bowen's ancestor's encounter with the fabled beast from
beyond, as well as real chains with which to bind it.  Stated Phillips, &quot;He rambled
on about beasts from the deep, horrors out of time, and creatures from the grav-
buy his latest sculpture and you'll realize Randy Bowen is completely insane!&quot;
The Jimmy Leggs was unavailable for comment at press time.<br>
Suggested retail: statue  $130.00,  model kit $90.00
