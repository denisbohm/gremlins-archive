Unless you are the producer of the kit that you are adding, you
should leave the comment blank.  Comments about your buildup of
a kit should be made on the Buildup Add form - not here.

<b>Why Isn't The Sculptor or Producer Listed?</b><br>
There is info on over a thousand contacts in the gremlins database.
If all their names were sent over with this web page, you would
be waiting a while and it would be hard to find the name that you
are looking for in the large list.  So only names that have been
noted as "Favorites" are listed.
</p>
<p>
To note a name as a favorite:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.gremlins.com/servlet/Logon"><b>Logon</b></a>.
<li>Go to the
<a href="http://www.gremlins.com/servlet/Contact"><b>Contact Search Page</b></a>
(which can also be found by going to the "Resources" section and
following the "Contact" link).
<li>Search for the name.
<li>If you find the name listed then click on the name and then
on the next page click on the "Note" button.  The next time you
reload this page you will see the name listed.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
If you do not find the name listed then you can add it.  When you
add a name it is automatically noted as a favorite.  To add a name:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.gremlins.com/servlet/Logon"><b>Logon</b></a>.
<li>Go to the
<a href="http://www.gremlins.com/servlet/Contact?onAdd"><b>Contact Add Page</b></a>
(which can also be found by going to the "Resources" section and
following the "Contact" link and then clicking on the "Add" button).
<li>Fill out the form and press the "Insert" button.
</ol>
