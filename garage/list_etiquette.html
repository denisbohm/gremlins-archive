<h2>Mailing List Etiquette 101</h2>
<ul>

<li>When you are replying to a message, first ask yourself <b>who</b> will most
benefit from reading it.  Is it something I just want to pass along to the
original poster, or will the entire readership find it of interest.  If
it's something only the original author needs to know, then you should
change the reply-to field before you send out the email!

<li>If you pass step one and feel that the message is something you want
to share with gremlins around the world, feel free to reply to the list.
newstuff, figures and anime are all about sharing information!

<li>If you do reply to the list, take care to edit the original post.
Quoting huge sections of the original post is wasteful and irritating to
many readers.  Pluck out the most relevent portions of the original article
and address them with your reply.

<li>Please don't write your messages all in <b>CAPITALS</b>! It's hard to read and is the
online equilavlent of shouting!

<li>Don't flame people!  If you aren't interested in a specific topic
just let it drop and do not reply to it.  Like mom always said:
<i>If you don't have something nice to say then don't say anything at all.</i>

<li>Please let others know who you are by signing your message.
There are a lot of messages from corporate/ambiguous email
addresses, such as 100277.3720@compuserve.com,
with no indication of who exactly it came from.
People like to know who they are talking to.

<li>Finally, remember that these lists are for modeling fans.  Posting
chain letters or information about the latest basketball standings are
probably of little interest to most folks who will be reading your email.
Follow the golden rule:
<i>Email unto others as you would have them email unto you!</i>

</ul>
Keep in mind
that excessive postings will generally drive away new subscribers - who you
should think of as potential pen-pals!  We're all here to share tips,
reviews, and experiences about figure modeling.  New readers expect that
and shouldn't be subjected to a constant barage of inane babbling upon
subscription.
