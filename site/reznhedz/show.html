Modelers from around the country can gather at
this multimedia show to celebrate two of the hottest collectible trends in
the world: Figural Models and Toys. Model Kits come in all sizes and shapes
from airplanes to ships to cars. Many years ago they also were made of famous
movie and historic figures. Figure kits were made of famous sports heroes,
comic book characters, and even medieval knights. The most beloved plastic
models were made by the Aurora Model company back in the 1960s.  The monster
kits  representing the great Universal (tm) Monsters: Frankenstein, The Wolf
Man, Dracula, Creature from the Black Lagoon and others are fondly remembered
by baby boomers are highly sought after by collectors.

<p>

Breed Appears</b></font><br>
   In the early 1980s, however, a new breed of modeler arose. Working in
their basements and garages these early sculptors and casters worked in the
new medium of clays that could be cured in a home oven and plastic compounds
call resin which was easy to pour into small molds at home.
<p>
    Figure kits are now back with a startling array of exquisitely crafted
pieces that appeal to the collector and the modeler. Today's figure kits
redefine the entire idea of modeling from accurate representations of a
static piece to a vivid recreation of a scene from a movie or creating
imaginary scenes from movies we'd all like to see. It's not enough anymore to
have the alien from the ALIEN (tm)  on your mantle. How about an Alien
fighting Arnold Schwarzenegger, or  a FEMALE stormtrooper from STAR WARS
(tm).
<p>
     In a sense model kits are  part of a dialgoue between the fans of
 horror and science fiction films and their creators.  Model Kits today
explode with a king of creative energy that is drawing in thousands of people
into the hobby. The established industry of vehicle model kits is taking
notice and are venturing into this market with product of their own. The
whole industry is poised to break out of its hobby origins into the wider
world of the mass market.

That is why  our company REZNHEDZ wanted to bring a Figural Model and Toy
show to Chicago. Successful shows are held in other parts of the country from
CHILLER in the East, WONDERFEST in the South, and MAD MODEL PARTY on the West
Coast. Now it's the Midwest's turn to experience the magic and excitement of
this hobby with our show in Chicago area.
<p>
Film star Brinke Stevens has always loved this industry and was on of
the first to be immortalized with a licensed Figure Kit of her character:
Brinke of Eternity. It is an honor to have her grace our convention.
<p>
Bob Burns is an old time special effects man and film historian who
worked on classic science fiction films like &quot;It Conquered the World&quot; and
&quot;Invasion of the Saucerman&quot;. He is also a world-renowned collector of science
fiction and horror movie memorabilia. His incredible collection spans the
entire genre from the wolf's-head cane head  prop from &quot;The Wolf man&quot; to
model props from &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;Predator.&quot; His two prize
possessions have to be the original King Kong stop motion puppet (stripped
down to its metal frame), and the original Time Machine from the 1950's
movie.
<p>
   Bob's funny and unique style (Nobody ever call him Mr. Burns) has made him
a popular guest at other shows and he now appears on SCI FI CHANNEL's
 segment &quot;Bob's Basement&quot; and DISCOVERY CHANNEL's &quot;Movie Magic.&quot; Bob will
entertain us at a special banquet to be held Saturday night.
<p>
Other guests to our show include Debbie Dutch one of the best &quot;Scream
Queens&quot; who work in horror films and Countess Vladimira a popular character
at comic and multimedia conventions.
Model Contest, Seminars, and an All Night MOVIE MARATHON
<p>
In addition to our guests we are promoting a model contest sure to
attract some of the finest talent in the Midwest. Seminars will be held on
painting, building, and sculpting model kits. An All night Monster Movie
Marathon is planned. There will be door prizes and raffles to raise funds for
the Chicago Food Depository a charity we take pride in sponsoring.
<p>
We are committed to making this a great show an look forward to seeing you
all there. Do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or
requests at (708) 386-6550. Ask for Cory Glaberson.
