<p>Dear Fellow Modelers,</p>
<p>
Ever since my shark attack, I've not been feeling to well. This all started
like most other days in sunny Southern California. I stopped by the Mad Model
Party and was walking by Creature Feature's table when The Great White Death
jumped off the table and bit me with the need to build this mammoth kit.</p>
<p>The Great White
Death is sculptor and special effects artist John Cherevka's personal
project. After many requests John has made this piece available exclusively
through Creature Features and <a href="http://www.squidzkitz.com">www.squidzkitz.com</a>.
John's talents as a sculptor can really be appreciated with the release of
this giant kit. John's work can also be seen in movies like Dogma and TV
show's like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the X Files. The feel of this kit is
epic featuring the giant shark measuring in at 32 inches in length. This kit
also comes with many cool accessories, a shark tooth base, half eaten
corpse and a female diver. Plus the shark's teeth are cast out of acrylics,
which are used to make dentures. Great White Death features a tremendous amount
of detail and is well cast.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.gremlins.com/walter_evans/gwd_image9.jpg" width="593" height="266"></p>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.gremlins.com/walter_evans/gwd_image3.jpg" width="431" height="295"></p>
<p>
After seeing this kit I got home as safely as possible and watched Jaws.
There's many great prehistoric kits available, but this kit is and opportunity
to own one of the last true prehistoric creatures that exist today. John has
added a prehistoric feel to his sculpture. This makes the shark that much more
menacing. The casting's of this kit are really clean for a piece this size,
with only minimal mold lines that can easily be removed with your fingernail and
a exacto knife. The fins need to have the pore spout's removed but that's no
problem either. They can be grinded off or cut with and exacto saw.</p>
<p>
Once the clean up was finished which tuck about 45 minutes. I glued the figure
together with super glue and accelerator. Then filled in the seams with Magic
Sculpt epoxy putty. The diver and the corpse also needed a little putty work but
that only tuck about 5 minutes to finish. A simple build when you consider the
size of this beast. When building this creature I was wondering how I was going
to paint him. Well I thought I'll try to make him look as much like a great
white as I could. But then I started thinking I really like the paint scheme of
the sharks in The Deep Blue Sea, which are based on Mako sharks. Well what I
came up with is a paint scheme that combines the colors of each animal.</p>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.gremlins.com/walter_evans/gwd_image7.jpg" width="506" height="380"></p>
<p>Once assembled, I premiered this beast with my favorite primer Dupli-Color's
scratch filler&amp; primer. This also gives the shark a base coat of light gray
to start with. The belly of the Great White is where he gets his name. His belly
was airbrushed with Titanium White.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.gremlins.com/walter_evans/gwd_image1.jpg" width="502" height="376"></p>
<p>Then a
light coat of Dead Guy Gray was airbrushed at the top of the White. This
Greenish Gray color will be used to tie the White belly into the upper bodies
color scheme.</p>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.gremlins.com/walter_evans/gwd_image8.jpg" width="551" height="418"></p>
<p>
The broken pattern that separates the white under belly from the upper half of
the shark was added by using a flat brush and Freak Flex Nocturna Blue mixed
with Payne's Gray. This was applied by lightly dipping the brush into the
paint then stippling the shark down the length of his body. I used National
Geographic for my reference. This helped a lot with the placement of the
pattern. This edge needs to be very jagged not a smooth line. Remember this is
and animal and nothing is symmetrical on it. Remember, it doesn't really need
to be exactly like the other side. Asymmetrical is more interesting due to the
nature of things being different. After this break line is complete I went a
head and colored the rest of the upper body in the same fashion using the color
to break up the Gray base color.</p>

<h2>Step 4</h2>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.gremlins.com/walter_evans/gwd_shark03.jpg" width="514" height="387"></p>
<p>
I then took my airbrush and highlighted the high points of the shark with Mossy
Moor Brown, which is a dark greenish brown color. This color was also applied to
the rest of the upper body. Then other highlights where added with Gangreen,
Frankenflesh. Adding these colors brought the pattern more in line with the
Great White's color scheme. Once this was complete the figure was then lightly
misted with Transparent Black.</p>

<h2>Step 5</h2>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.gremlins.com/walter_evans/gwd_image02.jpg" width="398" height="526"></p>
<p>Not too bad, now on to what we all like about sharks, their giant
menacing mouths. The mouth was already painted white so I sprayed the inside of
the mouth with a mixture of Red, Burnt umber. Then the teeth where base coated
with Bleach Bone Tan which is kind of and off White. Great White Death's teeth
and mouth where then washed with Burnt Umber. The last step was to highlight the
teeth with a light drybrushing of White. When a shark attacks its prey there
eye's rollover and a white membrane covers the eye. I wanted to create the
illusion of the eye's rolling back; this was accomplished by painting the
eye's White first then placing the Black iris where I wanted. Once this was
complete the figure was then coated with clear lacquer, the eyes and mouth where
hit with a gloss coat.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.gremlins.com/walter_evans/gwd_image04.jpg" width="506" height="380"></p>

<h2>Step 6</h2>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.gremlins.com/walter_evans/gwd_image07.jpg" width="557" height="421"></p>
<p>I really dig that not only does this kit come with a corpse but also
comes with a 4inch female diver. Her outfit was base coated with Navy Blue, the
White was added the drybrushed on. This brought out the detail nicely. The
straps and goggles where painted yellow with a wash of Burnt Umber. Her air tank
was painted Gunmetal, then the air hose was applied using superglue. Next the
corpse, this poor chap must have been surfing one to make waves when this beast
got him. He was base coated with a mixture of Burnt Umber, Raw Amber and white.
Once dry he was drybrushed with a lighter version of the base coat then washed
with Burnt Umber. The mutilated area was base coated with a Hammer Horror Red
then washed with a dark Purple to give it that deep wound effect. The corpse and
the diver where then sprayed with dull coat then a light gloss coat. This gave
them a nice wet look.</p>

<h2>Step 7</h2>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.gremlins.com/walter_evans/gwd_image01.jpg" width="349" height="187"></p>
<p>Now on to the base this has to be one of the coolest bases I've seen. I
just dig the giant tooth. I live in Bakersfield Ca. and thousands of years ago
this area was covered by ocean. Once the oceans reseeded a lot of sea life died
in this area. The giant Meglodon shark was one such animal. There's been allot
of his teeth found near Shark Tooth Hill hear in Bakersfield. I've seen these
teeth and I'm telling you there awesome and this tooth is almost a perfect
match. Now on to the painting, base coated with Freak Flex Bleached Bone Tan,
and then washed with Freak Flex Mossy Moor Brown. The outside edge was then
painted Black. The metal rod was painted Black as well.</p>
<p>The corpse was base coated with a mixture of Burnt Umber, Raw Umber and
White. The rest of the body was painted different color Reds. Red mixed Burnt
Umber, Purple and Forest Green, these different reds gave the corpse a nice
mixture of deep wound color reds. Then the entire kit was sprayed with Testors
Dull Coat. The corpse was placed in
the shark's mouth and the diver was super glued to the front of the sharks
face. This completes the painting and building of this mammoth figure once
complete this piece makes and excellent addition to anyone's collection.</p>
This figure can be purchased through <a href="http://www.squidzkitz.com">www.squidzkitz.com</a>
or Creature Features in Burbank Ca. If anyone is interested in contacting John
for a commission sculpture or pre-painted shark please contacted <a href="http://www.squidzkitz.com">www.squidzkitz.com</a>.
They will be able to get you in touch with him. One last thing before I go is
this sneak peak at one of John's figure busts the Mummy based on his own
design. This is and in progress picture, look for and upcoming article featuring
some of John's fantastic busts. Till next time don't glue your fingers
together.
