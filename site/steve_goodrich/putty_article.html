   come up with the most tried and true article on the subject of fillers and epoxy
putties, we must first address two subjects.
<p>
  The first being that we will assume one wishes to read about products which do
not crack nor &quot;unglue&quot; from the kit itself after ten or fifteen years. We must assume
one is looking for products which will have no known life and virtually last forever.
<p>
  Second, we must assume that one realizes &quot;one size does not fit all.&quot; We need to
match the filler/putty to the material of the kit itself. Otherwise, we will be headed for
disaster from the word go.
<p>
  First up, lets deal with the oldest of the three mediums for kits; styrene. This is the
hard plastic which is injected into molds creating &quot;trees&quot;  from which we clip parts.
This is the hard plastic we all know from the aurora kits.
<p>
  Filler for this medium should never, ever be anything but fillers that come in tubes
such as Squadron Green! This volatile material actually attacks the styrene... melts
it to an extent and mates well. Drawbacks on these fillers are that they dry slowly
and shrink. This later point means you may need to add a layer or two once
curing is accomplished.
<p>
  Properly cured (overnight) Squadron Green type &quot;tube putties&quot; sound very easy,
but these type of fillers should only be use on styrene and nothing else! Used on
all vinyl kits and some resins; these two materials have a tendency to move on a
molecular to obviously level over the years.
<p>
  Tube fillers, while held in place by paint to these materials, do not bond with
them and will crack over time. Tube fillers, unless bonded with styrene, cure hard
and brittle.

  Vinyl kits, especially, need a putty which locks in with the piece. If you can't make
your present A.B. epoxy pass the following tests, scrap it!
<p>
  Mix parts A and B  (a small dab) according to package directions. Let it cure for
about a week. Now, test this dab (say a small roll or &quot;snake&quot;). Does it bend or does
it break? If it snaps rather than bending a bit before it snaps, throw it in the trash.
<p>
  Next take a waste rim from both hard and soft vinyl: Extreme end of hard would
be a Horizon kit and the extreme end of soft would be the nearly flesh like quality:
ie. Halcyon's Facehugger. The vinyl of Screamin' kits is a happy medium.
<p>
  Mix a small wad of your present A.B. epoxy and press it onto a scrap of prewashed
and dried vinyl. The following day, if it can be removed by bending the vinyl or
peeling it off, try this again using a few dots of super glue on the waste piece of
vinyl. If this second experiment fails to bond the plastic to putty...loose the putty!
<p>
  There are two A.B. epoxy putties that pass the tests which weren't actually
developed for this hobby and they are both user friendly and pass all environ-
mental tests of not producing lethal fumes nor curing reactions.
<p>
  The first is called Kneadatite, or &quot;green&quot;. This is a ribbon of yellow and blue.
When you clip off a section and knead it together, it becomes green. (massive
surprise here!)
<p>
  This putty has amazing stick! So much so that one must keep rubbing tools or
brush handle (use the latter to roll out the edges, like a rolling pin, for flat surfaces)
against the side of the nose. This putty will stick to anything and has an amazing
&quot;flex&quot;. (anything meaning a plastic surface prewashed)
<p>
  Rubbing your sculpting tool aside your nose from time to time, picks up a thin
layer of skin oil that repels the &quot;green&quot;. Otherwise, &quot;green&quot; will cling to your tool.
If this method seems gross, consider that dipping a tool in cooking oil, will create
too much of an oily problem. &quot;Green&quot; does not respect water and there is no
better way to control this putty than with what God has endowed us with.
<p>
  Working time of &quot;green&quot; is from thirty to sixty minutes, depending on the size of
the mix. If you can fill and sculpt what you desire in five minutes, you can feel
free to prime and/or paint right over &quot;green&quot;. If has a chemical cure, or &quot;kick&quot;,
and is not affected by things like water, or air dry time. (in fact, it will “kick” under
water) So, paint away over it.
<p>
  &quot;Green&quot;, after it fully cures, can also be dremeled, filed and sanded down to
the point of fine wet/dry sanding of any other A.B. epoxies.
<p>
  Product number two from Polymeric is their literally outrageous A.B. epoxy
called Repair-it-quick. This is presently sold through &quot;New Pig&quot; exclusively
as &quot;Pig Putty&quot;. But outrageous is the only superlative that can describe this
material!
<p>
  It is used like all A.B. epoxies, yet cures concrete hard with still a bit of
flex. Water is used to smooth out rather than oil. It is especially sublime to build
up missing teeth or claws which frequently fail to fill out in resin.
<p>
  Drawback is that it cures fast. With a pea sized mix, one has only about three
minutes to work. You can quickly work up small area of filling and count on Pig
Putty sanding or filing very well.
<p>
  You can order six 120 tubes of Pig Putty for $32.00 (plus shipping) or, a small
free sample by calling New Pig toll free at 1-800-HOT-HOGS (1-800-468-4647).
