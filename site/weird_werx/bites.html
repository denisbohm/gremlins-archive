<b>Weird Werx</b> of Powder Springs, Georgia is announcing the release of

<p>
The piece was sculpted by noted artist <b>Jim Peavy</b>. Peavy's art has graced
the covers of successful genre publications such as Wonder Magazine and
Scary Monsters Magazine. &quot;I can't believe that so little has been done of
Peter Cushing&quot;, notes Peavy, &quot;he is one of my all time favorite actors
and I believe that this bust is a fitting tribute to him. I really loved
sculpting it.&quot;
<p>
The bust is approximately 10 inches high by 6 inches wide including base
and features a relief name plate bearing the actor's birth and death dates.
The full color box top features a brand new painting of the actor by Peavy.
Cast in Poly-resin, the piece retails for $59.95 + $4.50 shipping and
handling and is currently available from<br>
