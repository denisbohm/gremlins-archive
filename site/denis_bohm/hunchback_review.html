Just reading the title brings about vivid memories of ringing bells
and gothic images of stone gargoyles.
Aurora captured the essence of this classic story back in the '60s with
a single moment frozen in plastic.  If you built the original
Aurora kit back when it was first released I'm sure you will
remember it!
<p>
Aurora's original copyright on The Hunchback Of Notre Dame kit
was registered in 1963 and never renewed.
If a copyright originally secured before January 1, 1964, was not
renewed at the proper time, copyright protection expired at the
end of the 28th calendar year of the copyright, and could not be
restored.  Thus, this kit entered the public domain in 1991.
<p>
Now in 1996, JimZ Hobbies honors this great kit by bringing it back
for all of us to enjoy again.  The molds for this new version were
made from original Aurora parts.  The parts are cast in tan resin.
I was very impressed with the quality of the parts! I couldn't spot
any mold lines or flash on any of the parts.  Most importantly, the
air bubbles that can plaque resin kits were almost totally absent!
This kit is on par with the best quality resin castings that I have
seen made in the US.

The parts come in a box with a copy of the original Aurora
box art.
A copy of the original instructions are also included.
You need to make sure you don't follow these directions and
use plastic cement on these parts.  Since the parts are made
out of resin superglue should be used.
<p>
This kit is
easier to build than the original plastic version.  There are no
sprues to remove the parts from, so this reduces the amount of
cleanup to be done.  Also, since the kit is resin, fast setting
superglue can be used.
<p>
One way to fill seams on this kit is to thin out some putty and
&quot;paint&quot; it on. Dr. Microtools Supreme Putty or Squadron White Putty
can be mixed with nail polish remover to thin down until it's a
little thicker than paint.  Then use a inexpensive brush and &quot;paint&quot;
the thinned putty into the seam.  After it dries just scrap away
with an X-Acto and the seam is filled. The same method can be used
to fill any air bubbles.  After scraping you can use a paper towel
or Q-Tip dampened with nail polish remover to smooth over the
scrape marks. You can even replicate the texture on the clothes
by dabbing with the towel. Just be careful not to use too
much remover or you'll wipe the putty out of the seam and have
to start over.
<p>
I decided to assemble the figure without his hands and chains
and then paint all the parts.  After painting I carefully cut
through the chain hoops and bent the hoops open so I could
put them around the appropriate parts of the figure.
Then a touch of superglue fastens the hoops back together.
This let me fill the seams and paint without having the
chains constantly in the way.
<p>
This is great kit!  I thoroughly enjoyed building and painting it!
