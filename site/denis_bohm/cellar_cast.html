Tell us about your art background, Steve.
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
I started out with drawing and painting which is what
I was really interested in.  The sculpting was kind of
by accident.  I was just messing around with clay.
I wasn't really setting out to be a sculptor.
It just sort of happened.  And I really liked it.
I have kind of gotten away from the drawing and painting.
Kits are taking up all of my time now.  I do everything
from the sculpting, then the mold making, the casting,
and the packaging.
<br clear="all">

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
Are you a kit collector?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
That's what got me started.  My first kit was the
Horizon Wolverine, their first vinyl one.  Then my
first resin kit was GEOmetrics Fright Night Amy kit.
<p>

<img src="cc_swamp.jpg" width="186" height="236" align="right"></center><br clear="all">
Then I started working on these sculptures and I
took them to a friend who told me I had to make
these into kits.  The first one was the Conan bust.
At that time I had the Swamp Thing almost done.  The
first person I contacted was Mark Kaelin.  He lives
in Oregon so we set up a meeting and drove down there
with those two sculptures. He was &quot;From the Ground Up&quot;.
He kind of got us started, showed us the right materials
to use.  Then he got out of it for a while and gave us
some of the bases that we are selling.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
What other sculptors do you like the most?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
I think my favorite would be Thomas Kuntz, because I
think that he captures likenesses the best.
Also Taishiro Kiya who did a lot for Horizon.
I like his work with anatomy.  And Takayuki Takeya does
the greatest details and textures.  There are many
good people out there for lots of different reasons.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
How long has Cellar Cast been around?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
My first sculpture I did in '92.  We have only been
an official business for a little over a year, but
we were using the name before that.
Up here in Seattle there aren't really many people
into figure kits so it's hard to get feedback on my stuff.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
How many kits have you sculpted?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
I have done about 6 or 7 commissioned works.
And about 10 for myself.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
What type of things do you like best? Fantasy, horror, sci-fi?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
Artistically my biggest influence was fantasy.  Like Frazetta.
Bernie Wrightson is probably one of my all-time favorites.
And of course Boris.
<p>
<center><img src="cc_princess.jpg" width="186" height="236"></center>
I was just doing the Boris piece, Primevil Princess, for myself.
I wasn't planning on making it a kit.  Then a friend of mine who
knows Boris's agent said I should contact them about doing a kit.
I sent them some pictures and they liked it.  Then they showed
Boris and he liked it to.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
What other companies have you sculpted for?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
Shawn McLaughlin from Death, Inc.
<p>
<center><img src="cc_quest.jpg" width="225" height="236"></center>
I did the Johnny Quest characters for The Shape Of Things.
That was kind of a nightmare.  That project took so long.
It wasn't really Matts fault.  Hanna Barbaras licensing
department would approve something then come back later
and ask for changes.  Matt originally wanted to do the
'60s characters.  But Hanna Barbara liked what they were
doing now with the new Johnny Quest.  They kept wanting
me to do changes that totally changed the look of the
old characters.
<p>
The greatest thing that I have found working with Boris
is that a lot of the input that I have goes a long way.
A lot of the other projects every thing is planned with
what you are supposed to do.  Working with Boris has been
really great.  The sculptures that I have done, all you
see from the painting is a front view so the back has
been totally made up.
<p>
I usually take videos and send them to get feedback on
the sculpture.  With video you can rotate the kit so you
can see it from all angles.  The angle can change the way
the kit looks so that works out really well. You don't
have to wait for the film to be developed, etc.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
How long does it take you to sculpt a kit?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
Usually about 2 months.  It depends because I don't
spend all of my time sculpting.  I'll sculpt a little,
do something else, then come back to the sculpture.
Most of my time I spend casting.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
How do you build up the sculpture?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
I start with a wire armature then go over it with
epoxy putty to make it stronger.  Then use Super
Sculpey for the rest.
Because a lot of times, Super Sculpey will crack
even when it's baked.   The epoxy putty kind of
limits the cracking.  That makes it kind of hard
to make a change when you have something half way
sculpted, but it makes it a lot more durable.
<center><img src="cc_sonja.jpg" width="163" height="236"></center>
Sometimes I'll use steel bearings for eyes, like on the
Boris kit for the beast I did that.  Sometimes I use
plaster for parts of a base.  Whatever I find that works good.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
Do you use any special tools for sculpting?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
I have a fine metal dental type spoon that I like a lot.
And two wood tools that I made myself.  I have all types
of tools that I have picked up to see how they work.
I try everything.  I tried magnifying things, but they
make my eyes feel weird.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
Do you sculpt parts of the kit separately?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
Sometimes I'll sculpt the head separately.  For the
licensed pieces I usually sculpt the head first then
get that approved.  For the Zealot  from Wildcats I
sculpted the head first. Then they needed some changes
so I changed it, then got it approved.  Then I did the body.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
What part do you like the best?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
I like the sculpting the best.  I like the mold making
and casting, but only to get the first pieces out.  After
the first ten kits it gets kind of boring, but that's when
it seems like you get the most orders.  Painting that
first one is really great.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
Are you going to stay with the casting?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
I can't see hiring someone else to do the casting.
Since my name is on there I want to be in charge of everything.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
Do you have any help?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
Melinda paints about half of the kits.  She does all the
office work and shipping.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
Do you do casting for other companies?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
I'm doing the Beach Blanket Beastie for Jim Groman,
in fact I was out there casting those today.  I did the
Shadow Hawk for GEOmetric, that was a limited run type thing.
I did this Jester for Fantasy World Studios.
I have done some other odds and ends.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
Are you planning on doing more of the bases?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
In fact I'm working on two new ones.  Hopefully they should
be ready for the Wonderfest show.  One is made for Frankenstein
the scene where he is stepping through the door. It will be the
two walls on either side and the door he is stepping through.
And then the other will be a city type base with craters on the
sidewalk where there has been explosions and then the wall will
have a big hole with bullet holes all around.  A lot of the kits,
like the Horizon ones, don't have bases and are really easy to
knock over.  To me, I love the figure kits with bases.  Because
it sets a mood for the kit. When you see a figure kit with the
base it adds so much more to it.
<center><img src="cc_bone.jpg" width="296" height="236"></center>

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
Are you going to do more of the name plates?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
Oh, yeah.  I have like ten or twelve more that I haven't molded yet.
Then I plan on doing some more. They are doing well.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
How do you feel about original designs versus licencesed characters?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
I like the original stuff, but it seems like it doesn't sell as well.
If they see something original they may think it's cool, but they
don't buy it.  So you are kind of limited if you do something original.
But it does cost a lot more for something licensed.  Because you have
to pay so much up front, then each kit you sell you have to pay a
percentage of.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
What comes with the kits?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
The bases are poly bagged with a card.  The kits come boxed with
color copy box art taken from a painted kit.  The older kits just
had general instructions.  The newer kits, especially the Boris ones,
have everything including painting directions for that kit.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
How do you feel about retail versus direct sales?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
I like selling direct the best.  But, the retail people we have
been going through have been really good. The direct sales
aren't that steady, and the retail places make up for that.
It seems like every couple of months or so our steady customers
will call up and order some.  It seems like we get most of our
orders after a show.  Every once in a while someone will call
and they say they saw a piece in a magazine. That's because we
try to get our new stuff ready before a show.

<p>
<img src="db.gif" alt="DB:" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12">
Is there anything you want to say to the modelers out there?
<p>
<img src="sw.gif" alt="SW:" WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="12">
I'd like to thank everyone who has bought my kits.  I'm still
amazed that so many people want to buy what I've done!
