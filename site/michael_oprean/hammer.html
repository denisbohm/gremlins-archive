whole diarama was a labor of love, I felt these were the
films that finally captured the real essence of the
&quot;Vampires&quot; created by Bram Stoker so long ago. The series
faltered near it's end, but the majority of the series brought
blood and sex to the genre. I'd wanted to do this tribute
for a long time but getting the parts of it was impossible until
recently. The base was not available anywhere, so I tried to
duplicate it on my own.  Here is the resulting Hammer Horror
Tribute diorama:

Model: <b>Dracula - Christopher Lee</b><br>
Material: <b>Resin</b><br>
Price: <b>$150.00</b><br>
Parts: <b>5</b> (plus base)<br>
Sculpted by: <b>Jeff Yeagher</b><br>
Produced by: <b>Monsters in Motion</b>
<p>
The &quot;Dracula&quot; kit is a breeze to build, with no air bubbles
and only minimum seams it went together nicely. The
cape did take some sanding to get it nice and smooth. I painted
the head and hands separately and glued them in place after
the body and base were finished. The cape needed some sculpting
done on one of the shoulders where it attaches to the
body, this was also painted seperately and attached when the
whole piece was assembled. The building and painting
instructions were followed closely as they matched the film
nicely. The only changes I made were to paint the inside of
the cape a different shade of black than the outside and I
didn't add any red to it. The pupils are undercoated faith gold
then overcoated with transparent red to make them appear to glow.
<p>
Model: <b>Van Helsing - Peter Cushing</b><br>
Material: <b>Resin</b><br>
Price: <b>$l20.00</b><br>
Parts: <b>l0</b> (plus base)<br>
Sculpted by: <b>Jeff Yeagher</b><br>
Produced by: <b>Monsters in Motion</b>
<p>
The &quot;Van Helsing&quot; kit was also easy to build and paint, no
air bubbles and a very thin seam had this ready in no
time. Again the parts were painted seperately, all components
were assembled when everything was past the painting
stage. The hardest part of this kit was to get the candlesticks
to line up correctly when the hands are attached to the
body, using pins and super-glue worked well. All the parts are
pinned and then glued to the main bodies.
<p>
The bases for both of these kits go together to make a marble
circle featuring the Zodiac. Therefore they were
painted at the same time using the same colors.
<p>
Model: <b>Hammer Vamp</b><br>
Material: <b>Resin</b><br>
Price: <b>$35.00</b><br>
Parts: <b>9</b><br>
Sculpted by: <b>Mike Parks</b><br>
Produced by: <b>Mad Lab Models</b>
<p>
The &quot;Hammer Vamp&quot; is a slab model, made to go in a coffin.
A little sanding on the sides and bottom are all it
needed to be ready for painting. The fangs were added after
the inside of the mouth was painted. This is a bit tricky as
thev are very tiny. I used Zap-A-Gap and Zip-Kicker and
tweezers, a one shot effort. I got lucky, they lined up
nicely. A small wooden stake that came with the kit was added
to her heart after she was painted and I tried to keep the
blood to a minimum.
<p>
Model: <b>Crypt Coffin Base</b><br>
Sculpted by: <b>Michael Oprean</b><br>
<p>
This was hand made by myself. When I could not find a issue of the original resin base produced
by J.L. Crinnon l decided to make my own. It is based on a picture of the original in - Rescnue Of
the Garage Kit That Ate My Wallet&quot;, a very useful resource. I used my own measurements and
fashioned all the separate parts out of particle board and 1/4&quot; plywood. The floor was made much
loner to acomidate the two bases that came with the models and then cut out so they would appear
to be inlaid. All the bricks and cracks were carved in using my Dremel with a pointed cutting bit
.The base is assembled using carpenters glue and wood screws. It was then primmed, painted flat
black. the drybrushed using several shades of greys to simulate the stone work. When finished this
is a rather large piece, but it does showcase a series of films that I grew up loving to watch.
<p>
Once everything was painted assembly was quite easy. The
Crypt Base had a circle cut out of it, the two
character bases were droped into this giving it the
appearence of being inlaid. The &quot;Vamp&quot; was placed in the Crypt then
the Crypt was attached to the wall. The heads and hands
were attached and the figures were pinned to their bases, finally
the cape for Dracula was glued to his shoulders.
<p>
Well that's about it. It's a big piece and it takes up
a lot of shelf space, but it was a fun project that I'm very
pleased with. This is a good example of incorporating a
number of kits to make a diorama of a favorite film scene or
maybe to create a scene that you can envision but never made
it to the screen.
<p>
Good Luck
