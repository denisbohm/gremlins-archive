weekend of August 24th and 25th, just outside of Boston at the Tara Sheraton Castle Hotel in
Framingham, Mass. A little known model show took place. <b>Paul Antonelli's</b>
<a href="../character_shop/index.html"><b>The Character Shop</b></a>
ran the fourth edition of the
<a href="index.html"><b>Monster Modelfest</b></a>!
And let me tell ya'... Keep your eyes open for next
years show because if you don't I'm gonna scarf up all those bargains <b>again</b>!! Although this
show is on a smaller scale with l277 fans and 100 dealers tables dominated by kits! It is the
friendly, laid back attitude that I really enjoyed! I got a chance to actually talk to guests, dealers
and kit builders that I haven't had a chance to in a long, long time! And I didn't hear any dealers
complaining about going home with less kits and more cash at shows end either!

Various up and coming kit manufacturers were showing off some really cool new kits that are
now a part of my ever growing collection. Although I know of only one dealer who did not stay
for Sunday (he will be kicking hisself in the butt since no less than 7 people, cash in hand, were
looking to buy his kits. So I was able to help fill in the void for those people nicely!! Thanks
R.F.T.G.!) Let me tell ya' this show surpassed everyones expectations! The guests were very
outgoing and Friendly. Seeing Caroline Munro in her 1 piece bathing suit Sunday morning on her
way to the indoor pool made me realize that there really is a God! David Fisher of AFM fame
once again shared his knowledge with a legion of fans. One tip in particular will be in my <i>We The
People</i> article in the December issue of Kitbuilders so look for it there! Brinke Stevens, Debbie
Rochon and a horde of Scream Queens were there looking more beautiful than ever, and
everyone's favorite &quot;undead&quot; John Russo and Bill Hinzman were on hand to help keep <i>Night of
the Living Dead</i> alive!!

But this shows main stars were the kits and believe me they didn't disappoint! <i>Python
Press</i>, <i>Model Citizen</i>, <i>3D</i>, <i>Alternative Images</i>, <i>Von Then</i>,
<i>Screamin'</i>, and a host of others were there
with loads of new kits to get your juices flowing. Kits from vintage <i>Aurora</i> to present day models
were to be had at prices that made grown men drool! How <i>The Character Shop</i> can sell kits at such
low prices boggles the mind!! My favorite part of the show was the auction. All proceeds were
given to the American Lung Assn.(A very worthy cause!!) All I can tell you about the auction was
that Kevin Clements Meadowlands Mafia really scored big time!! Movie posters and photos
signed by the great Ray Harryhausen, vintage and hard to find kits were practially given away (I
got about 10 kits myself) add into the mix an hourly door prize and raffles... Well lets just say I
don't think anyone went home empty handed. There was also a Poolside BBQ where the fans got
a chance to rub elbows with the guests at the outdoor pool...

All in all a good time was had by all. There are no dates set in stone for next year but I am told
that the show is moving back to Boston and will be held in September. The only problem I can
forsee for Paul and his crew (even you Charlie!) is... What are they gonna do with all the people
who are going to show up at the doors when word gets out.. Hmmmm! Maybe I should keep
this show to my greedy little self.. NAHH!!! It's too good not to share with my fellow Gremlins!
