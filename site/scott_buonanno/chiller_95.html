<img src="../garage/letter/c.gif" alt="C" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="31">hiller Theatre held its biannual Science fiction,
Horror, Toy, Model and
Film expo the weekend of Oct 27-29 at the Secaucus, N.J. Hilton Hotel. Numerous
sci-fi and horror movie actors and actresses, kit producers and collectible
dealers showed up for what has become the largest sci-fi show in the Northeast.
From <b>Roger Corman</b> to the children of <b>Lugosi</b>, <b>Karloff</b>, and <b>Chaney</b>,
this show was
stocked with celebs to meet and greet. Horror hobbyists need not fear for
gargage kit talents such as <b>Shawn Nagle</b>, <b>Terry Webb</b>, <b>Dave Fisher</b>,
Mad Labs' <b>Mike Parks</b>, <b>Wayne the Dane Hanson</b>, <b>Gordy Dutt</b> and many
others came to show off their
new wares.

<h3>New Kits</h3>

There were plenty of new kits to look at. <b>Fewture Models</b> was in attendance all
the way from Japan. In addition to a new <b>Nina Delono</b> kit, they were showing a
soon to be available <b>Genocyber</b> kit. Large and impressively sculpted, this will
be a must have for Japanimation fans.

<p>
A new outfit called
<a href="../garage/companies.html#Fantasy World Studios"><b>Fantasy World Studios</b></a>
had several pieces to show.
First was <b>Dr. Nefarious</b>, a disembowled zombie physician. Also from FWS was a
piece called <b>Jester</b>, featuring a stalking creature in a Jesters outfit out for
no good. These kits feature color box art and Nefarious came with a comic book
drawn by the sculptor. Nice clean castings make this outfit a winner in the
making.

<p>
<a href="../garage/companies.html#G-Force"><b>G-Force</b></a>
was down from Canada with their line of <b>Predators</b> and <b>Predettes</b>.
I don't know if its new or not but it still bears mentioning. G-Force makes a 1/3
scale predator in resin. Standing around 28 inches tall, this kit is a monster. If you
like to build 'em big, look to G-Force and their intimidating Predator. At $500,
its not cheap, but may be the ultimate predator for your collection.

<p>
<a href="../garage/companies.html#Mad Lab Models"><b>Mad Lab Models</b></a>
debuted their new <b>Ymir</b> kit. If you're familiar with their creature
charicatures, you'll be pleased to know that this is their best yet. The Ymir
stands roughly 4 inches tall and clutches a particular Disney cartoon pachyderm in his
claw. Also new from Mad Labs was their <b>Threshold</b>, a well sculpted pillar topped
with a succubus and standing nearly 18 inches tall. Very nice overall.

<p>
<a href="../garage/companies.html#Nightlife Productions"><b>Nightlife Productions</b></a>
continues to put out their line of figures.
Featuring roughly 1/8 scale <b>vampires</b>, <b>werewolves</b> and <b>fiends</b>,
these kits are very
nicely done and are affordable too. I believe most were sculpted by Ian Coulter
who previously had lots of stuff put out through <b>Soldat</b>. One interesting line
was a western themed zombie line.
<a href="../garage/companies.html#Big Dan Productions"><b>Big Dan Productions</b></a>
from N.H. contracted
<b>Coulter</b> to sculpt these kits and is selling them through Night Life. The
<b>Preacher</b> kit, features a recently hanged cowboy zombie man of the cloth with a
noose hanging around his neck, ready to deliver a fire and brimstone sermon from
the good book he holds aloft . These kits are neat if only for the fact that
they incorporate the western and horror genres together. Add to that the fact that
they are well sculpted with bases and in the $70 dollar range and these kits
should be very well received Also from Night Life was <b>Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS</b>.
Approximately 1/6 scale, Ilsa looks like she means business.There was also a
nicely done <b>Jerry Garcia</b> bust for all the mourning Dead Heads. Most of the other
Night Life kits are stand alone kits without bases. Night Life was also selling
male anatomical blanks in two styles. They are sponsoring a contest for those of
you who like to resculpt and reconfigure kits that will be held at the spring
Chiller Theatre show.

<p>
<a href="../garage/companies.html#Posthumous Productions"><b>Posthumous Productions</b></a>
was there with their wonderful <b>Mother of Invention</b>
Kit. This kit is a beautiful tribute to Frank Zappa complete with stage, amp and
guitar. Along the same lines is the <b>VooDoo Chile</b>. This was one of the best kits
of the show, IMHO. Featuring the late great Jimi Hendrix in full regalia, a
wonderfully animated pose, a stage with a Marshall Stack and the option of a
Strat or Flying V guitar, you could almost hear the feedback from the amps. This
is a wonderful tribute piece to one of the most innovative players of the
period.

<p>
<a href="../garage/companies.html#Sideshow Inc"><b>Sideshow Inc.</b></a>
had order forms and color flyers for the upcoming
<b>Wrightson Frankenstein</b>. Judging from the pictures, and from the glowing words of
Terry Webb and Dave Fisher, this kit will be a must have.

<h3>Other News</h3>

<a href="../garage/magazines.html#Amazing Figure Modeler"><b>Amazing Figure Modeler</b></a>
is back on the right track. <b>Terry Webb</b> was in
attendance with <b>David Fisher</b> at his side. The back drop for their booth was a
blowup for their next issue due in early December. Terry explained that the long
delay between issues was caused by a change in the production team. <b>Joe Molnar</b>
decided he needed to devote more time to his business and couldn't devote the
necessary time to AFM. Joe stepped aside, and Dave Fisher stepped in. Speaking
of Dave, his new <a href="../garage/videos.html#Model Mania"><b>Model Mania</b></a>
video was for sale. Featuring sections on advanced
airbrushing and metallic finishes, it seems like a natural followup to his
first, excellent video.

<p>
<b>KDM Productions</b> is now being run under the
<a href="../garage/companies.html#Alternative Images Productions"><b>Alternative Images Productions</b></a>
flag. AI will
be putting out the KDM line from now on. Anybody who has seen the excellent KDM
Kandaharian Demon, Bub, Henrietta and other kits will be happy to know they will
still be around.

<p>
<a href="../garage/companies.html#Netherworld"><b>Netherworld</b></a>,
makers of the excellent Julia and  Dr. Channard from
Hellraiser kits didn't have any new kits to show, but still are in the news.
Their <b>Xenomorphous Rex</b> will be reissued sometime next year. A giant kit weighing
in at 15 lbs, this wasn't even the big news. Netherworld sculptor <b>Paul Komoda</b>
and horror giant <b>Clive Barker</b> will be collaborating on an original character
kit. Komoda wouldn't say much, but would say it would be developed from a Barker
illustration and that Barker would probably do the box art. If you are a Barker
fan, this is huge news. With his imagination and the excellent sculpting of
Komoda, and the excellent production values of Netherworld, this may turn into
one of the most eagerly awaited kits of next year.

<h3>Summary</h3>

Once again Chiller pulls no punches in putting on the best Sci-fi horror
show in the Northeast. Between <b>Corman</b>, the <b>children of the alltime greats</b>,
artists <b>Ed Repka</b> (all those Megadeth covers), <b>Basil Gogos</b> (Famous Monsters
Magazine), <b>Ben Chapman</b> (Creature from the Black Lagoon) and all the scream
queens (<b>Monique Gabriel</b>, <b>Julie Strain</b>, <b>PJ Soles</b>),
the show was well attended by
celebs. Add to this three rooms full of vendors selling everything from old
scripts to posters and prints to autographs to the latest resin and vinyl, this
was the place to be. In fact if you were anywhere in the Northeast and are a
horror fan and weren't there, you need to ask yourself, &quot;What was I thinking?&quot;
The only downsides to the show were the fact that it is just too big. They need
to hold it somewhere with more parking and more space, maybe like the nearby
Giants stadium or Brendan Byrne Arena. Its THAT BIG.

<p>
Last was the one wiseguy
vendor selling recasts. This clown was selling resin recasts of The Dark Horse
Alien for $200 and had lots of other recasts too. Bad enough to be a ripoff
artist, but to be a greedy ripoff artist? Get a clue and don't come back.

<p>
Anyway, thats the story from Chiller Theatre Fall 95. Hope you enjoyed the
article.
