<center><b><font size="+2">Horizon News Flashes</font></b></center>
<p>
<b><font size="+1">Horizon's entire Marvel Comics line to be discontinued!</font></b>
<p>
Horizon has been making model kits of Marvel Comics' heroes and villains for 8 years. Most
vinyl model kit enthusiasts own at least one Horizon/Marvel kit (if not the entire collection) and
collectors anxiously await every new release while desperately searching for those kits they
might have missed. Unfortunately, due to license expiration, this popular line will now be
discontinued. Horizon will stop production of all Marvel kits at the end of the year and stop selling
all of their Marvel Vinyl and Solid Model kits after February 28, 1997. Of course, retailers and
distributors may have many of these kits available for some time after February 28th but, as past
Horizon discontinuations have revealed, these kits will quickly become highly sought-after
collector's items selling for far more than their original retail prices. Don't miss this last chance to
stock up on some of the hottest model kits around!

<b><font size="+1">The Penguin is Coming</font></b>
<p>
DC Comics' infamous Batman nemesis, The Penguin,
will be heading your way soon. The next character to
join Horizon's expanding line of 1/8 scale Batman figure kits,
The Penguin will be available beginning in February '97.
The kit, sculpted by Charles (Bane) Rivera, will include
the Street Base with Manhole and an umbrella.
The suggested retail price is $99.95.

The suggested retail price is $45.00.

The Whirly-bats 1/24 scale Solid Model Kits with Batman or Robin

Christmas And, coming soon in 1997 1/8 scale kits of The Penguin (see above), KnightsEnd Batman

<b><font size="+1">Batman vinyl kits are coming soon now with bases included</font></b>
<p>
Horizon will soon begin releasing vinyl versions of their
popular 1/8 scale Batman model kits: Batman, Robin, Catwoman, The Riddler and Bane.
Each kit will include the figure and a street base with manhole.
Horizon is frantically working on themed bases, available separately, for Batman
and each of the other characters as well.
<p>
<b><font size="+1">Announcing a new line of Horizon Collectibles</font></b>
<p>
Horizon is introducing a different form of the Original Statuettes series:
HORIZON Original Statuettes with Some Assembly Required.
This line will come fully painted but will require a minimal
amount of fairly easy assembly that practically anyone can do. Unlike our model kits which
require the use of sharp hobby knives and other hobby tools to assemble, these statuettes have
male/female joints that fit together perfectly and only require gluing
<p>
First to be released in this series are two popular characters from Terminator 2: Judgment Day
17402 T2 T-800 Endoskeleton and 17403 T2 T-800 Terminator (&quot;Arnold&quot;).
Each easy-to-assemble statuette includes a themed base with logo plate. They are 1/5 scale
solid resin, hand-painted collectibles. Available in early 97.
<p>
Also NEW Terminator 2: Judgment Day Mini Figures:
Pewter mini figures of the T-800 Terminator (17202), Sarah Connor (17203), and the T-1000
(17204) will be released in early '97 with more on the way.

<b>KNIGHTQUEST BATMAN</b>
</font></center>
<p>
Jean Paul Valley (a.k.a. Azrael) took over as the Batman
while the real Batman (Bruce Wayne) recovered from the
broken back he received in his fight with Bane.
Valley was not content, however, with the original Batman
costume. He created an &quot;armored&quot; costume that evolved
several times through the <i>Knightfall</i>, <i>Knightquest</i>, and
<i>KnightsEnd</i> storylines.
This holiday season Horizon will release
<b>Knightquest Batman</b>. This dynamic Solid Model Kit
is being sculpted by Toshi Usui (Robin &amp; Sil from <i>Species</i>)
and will be the next release in our continuing series of
1/8 scale Batman characters. Additional characters will be
announced in the soon. Positioned in a fighting pose
with a huge flowing cape, Knightquest Batman's suggested
retail is $99.95. <i>Available this holiday season!</i>
