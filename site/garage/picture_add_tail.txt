<b>Image Rules</b><br>
There are some rules that must be followed when preparing images
for the gremlins web site.  The rules describe the acceptable
image size, file size, format, and file name.  The types of images
that you prepare depends on if you are submitting a gallery entry,
kit review, or bites press release.  For example, to submit a
gallery entry you only need a full size and icon image.  The
sections below describe the rules for each image type.

<p>
<i>Note: Always update your images to the web site before using
the "Add Buildup" form (otherwise visitors to the site will
see the entry in the gallery, but there won't be any images).</i>
