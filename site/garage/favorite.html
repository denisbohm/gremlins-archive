As you can see there was a tie in the <b>Girls</b> genre.  There were
plenty of votes in the other categories, but there were not 5 or more more
for any specific kit.  The voters were a diverse bunch!
</i>

<p>
We were not trying to find &quot;the best&quot; kit for everyone, is there
any such thing?
But we did ask everyone to vote for their personal most favorite kits.
As such, the Gremmies recognize the most popular personal
favorite kits.
Since the Gremmies were decided by a mass voting I think
that is the most appropriate way to describe the award.
Thanks for telling us what your favorite kits are!

<p>
To be eligable a kit must have been released sometime in 1996 or
late 1995.
One kit in each category that has the most votes won
(a kit must have had at least five votes to be a winner).
People were allowed to vote for as many categories as they liked
and up to two kits in
each category.
The voting ended December 31st.
Each company that produced a winning kit will receive a 1996 Gremmie award!

Some things taken into consideration when deciding on favorite
kits were:
<dl>
<li><b>Originality</b> - character, overall design
<li><b>Sculpting</b> - detail, likeness, pose
<li><b>Base</b> - provides good support for the figure, enhances the look
<li><b>Scale</b> - shows detail, dispay are needed
<li><b>Casting</b> - offset seams, bubbles
<li><b>Material</b> - easy to work with, robust
<li><b>Assembly</b> - part fit, hidden seams, alignment, instructions
<li><b>Packaging</b> - attractive box art, well protected, size
<li><b>Availability</b> - hobby stores, mail order, direct
<li><b>Price</b> - appropriate
