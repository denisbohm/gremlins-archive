<b>Pictures</b><br>
Before you insert your buildup information you must first transfer
your <b>full image</b> and <b>icon image</b> pictures to the gremlins web site using
the <a href=http://www.gremlins.com/servlet/Picture><b>Picture</b></a>
page.
You can also list all of the picture files in your directory on the gremlins
web site by using the
<a href=http://www.gremlins.com/servlet/Picture?onFind><b>List of Pictures</b></a>
page.
</p>

<p>
<b>What is Path?</b><br>
The path is the file name of your full size picture, in your directory
on the gremlins web site, but without the
without the <b>.jpg</b> extension.  So if your
picture file name is <b>monster.jpg</b>
then the path to enter is simply <b>monster</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Why Isn't My Name Listed?</b><br>
There is info on over a thousand contacts in the gremlins database.
If all their names were sent over with this web page, you would
be waiting a while and it would be hard to find the name that you
are looking for in the large list.  So only names that have been
noted as "Favorites" are listed.
</p>
<p>
To note a name as a favorite:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.gremlins.com/servlet/Logon"><b>Logon</b></a>.
<li>Go to the
<a href="http://www.gremlins.com/servlet/Contact"><b>Contact Search Page</b></a>
(which can also be found by going to the "Resources" section and
following the "Contact" link).
<li>Search for the name.
<li>If you find the name listed then click on the name and then
on the next page click on the "Note" button.  The next time you
reload this page you will see the name listed.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
If you do not find the name listed then you can add it.  When you
add a name it is automatically noted as a favorite.  To add a name:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.gremlins.com/servlet/Logon"><b>Logon</b></a>.
<li>Go to the
<a href="http://www.gremlins.com/servlet/Contact?onAdd"><b>Contact Add Page</b></a>
(which can also be found by going to the "Resources" section and
following the "Contact" link and then clicking on the "Add" button).
<li>Fill out the form and press the "Insert" button.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>Why Isn't My Kit Listed?</b><br>
Same reason that your name wasn't listed.  And you follow the same
procedure to add a kit name to the list, except that you use the
<a href="http://www.gremlins.com/servlet/Kit"><b>Kit Search Page</b></a>
rather than the contact search page.
