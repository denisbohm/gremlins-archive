<img src="../garage/letter/b.gif" alt="B" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="30">ehold the complete story:
Many parts of this diorama are still in progress.
<p>
Surrounded by Predator and Alien carnage, an injured Queen lies with
barbed spikes in her carapace and a torn net hanging from the spikes.
Hours earlier she, her drones and elite guards defended their home from
many invading predators.  One Predator even survived to become a host for
her young.
<p>
Her offspring even now bursts forth from the Pred host in a blossom of
luminescent blood.
<p>
A short, green skinned, pointed eared creature is coccooned to the
wall(muttering &quot;Do or Do not; There is no try.&quot;)
<p>
A strange &quot;gill-man&quot; is coccooned upside down from an organic bone-like
structure from the slime covered wall.
<p>
Beta Pred team arrives to try for the Queen again and of course to kill
any Pred survivors/host.
<p>
<img src="hive_1.jpg" width="544" height="365">
<p>
Shorty is stabbing one alien with his right hand, holding another
alien by the throat, and stepping on yet another's alien's chest.
<p>
Piercing Tongue Collector is staring face to face with one of the
Queen's elite.  This annarexic? (impossibly skinny) alien is hold the
Predtor's face with his right taloned hand and the Predator's mask in the
other, while his long slithering tail immobilizes the Predator's right
arm.  The Queen's elite is about to deliver his own &quot;Piercing Tongue&quot; into
the Pred's face.  Will Piercing Tongue Collector's team mates be fast and
accurate enough with their plasma cannons?
<p>
<img src="hive_2.jpg" width="544" height="317">
<p>
<img src="hive_4.jpg" width="157" height="216" align="right">
On top of the hive, a flying alien with razor sharp talons swoops down
toward one of the hunters.  The Hunter prepares to launch a spear toward
the flying alien death dealer.
<p>
I do not plan to have any human carnage in this hive diorama, only alien
and predator carnage.
<p>
I am building this story/diorama in 1/8 scale.
<p>
 Completed charactors:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Piercing Tongue Collector (Dark Horse's Predator 2)
<li>The Queen's Elite Guard - (Repositioned Takeya's Alien (one of two)
<li>Flying Alien (a converted Dark Horse Alien Warrior with Cthulu's
    wings).
<li>Shorty (a repositioned S. Wang sculpted Pred toy prototype)
<li>Two Halcyon Alien 3 (one reposed crawling)
<li>One Dark Horse Alien 3
<li>Pred host with Pred burster (D.H.'s first Predator with a white
  metal alien emerging)
<li>Alien/Pred adult Hybrid (Ian Colter? sculpted - Eyeball
Productions?)
</ol>
<p>
Characters In progress:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Bug Hunt two Figure kit (Female (Machiko Noguchi?) in pred
armor/gear and one cool alien) Great cold-cast porcelain? sculpture!
<li>Pred throwing spear (Mostly good/great sculpture, I will add a
better sculpted medipack, net-caster, and hand/blade/guantlet.)
<li>Gort Pred with six mask option.
<li>Medicom aliens (repositioned)
<li>Reposed Halcyon aliens (repositioned ...crawling, leaping, hanging,
  climbing, dead, bleeding, etc.)
<li>Yoda (Victim...Sorry about that to all Star Wars fans. I am a Star
 Wars Fan too.)
<li>D.H.'s Creature from the Black Lagoon (Victim hanging upside down)
<li>Kaiyoda's 1/9 scale queen
<li>Kailyoda's Alien Warrior
</ol>
<p>
The Hive is three feet deep, two feet wide and about three and a half feet
tall.
The Hive structure is about 90% complete and internally illuminated by
six incandescent and two halogen lamps behind translucent agate? slabs for
that &quot;organic look&quot;.  The complete diorama with figures will be complete
in a year or so (I hope).
<p>
I have seven Agate Slices in the hive right
now.  I may add one more.  I used translucent 1/8 inch thick Agate
slices.  I purchased some from a local MJ Designs (Hobby Store) and from
The Cave, 5618 Bell Avenue, Dallas, TX 75206 (214) 824-5566.
<p>
 Agate is composed primarily of microscopically crystallized silica
(SiO2) and often occurs as a cavity filling in lavas.  Agate is formed
in layers and usually follows the shape of the cavity.  These specimens
are sawed and polished slices of agate that filled cavities in basaltic
rock or lava.  Some agate slices are treated with compounds and heated
to give them the brilliant blue, green and red colors.
<p>
Clear casting resin was poured over the Agate slices on the &quot;floor&quot; of
the hive.  Clear resin, Color kit (transparent dye: red, blue, yellow,
green, amber, &amp; pearl), and an excellent &quot;How to Video&quot;: &quot;Splash &amp;
Ripple Construction&quot; are available from WASCO TAXIDERMY, P.O. BOX 967,
1306 W. Spring St., Monroe, GA 30655, 1-800-334-8012.  Many of the
techniques taught in the video can be applied to &quot;hive slime&quot;,
&quot;exploding alien heads&quot; and &quot;alien drool&quot;.
<p>
I am always looking for more 1/8 scale kit for my hive.  If I need to, I
built it modular so I can add a second level between the top and primary
level or to the side corridors.
<p>
My goal was to build ... well ... when you disturb a fire ant hill, the
ants boil out of the ant hill.  I want to build this image with aliens.
