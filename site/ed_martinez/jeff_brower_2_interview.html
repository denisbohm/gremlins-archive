Last time we spoke with you, you had just completed the
sculpture of the female cenobite.<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
The next one after the female was the new pinhead, with the
altar of souls.
<p>

<img src="altar.jpg" width="111" height="216" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">
<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Whose idea was that?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
One day, on his way back from New York, Dan Fay had a brain
storm that it was a good idea to do another Pinhead. It was
shortly before the Christmas season, and they wanted to try
to get a Christmas pre-order out. It was done very rapidlly,
a quick decision, I think. I had fifteen days to do the
sculpture.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
That's short in comparison to other projects, right?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yeah. The altar of souls was done in one marathon eighteen
hour session. That is with the exception of the back. I
came in later and finished the back. That's why the back is
sort of flat.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
How did you go about it as far as armatures, reference,
sculpting materials, etc.<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
It was a pretty standard wire armature, and Sculpey.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Aluminum armature wire, or copper?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
I think I used coat-hanger wire, whatever was at hand.
Actually I start with scale drawings. I find out what the
height of the character is and I do a 1/4 scale drawing,
with the figure standing straight, like you would at the
doctor's office.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Where did you get the information for the different heights
of the characters?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
I think I just made it the same size as the other Pinhead.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
So that if you put all of the Cenobite kits next to each
other, they would be in the correct size in relation to one
another.<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes. I draw a sort of a stick figure within the 1/4 scale
drawings and use it as a template for my armature. So the
armature is done unposed.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Who chose the pose?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Daniel Fay. We were originally going to do the third
Pinhead (from the third movie). It was going to be the
crucifixion scene in the church, where he's laughing. It
just wasn't working out. Out of context, it was hard to
make him look sinister. It looked like he was having a
ball, like he was singing an opera or something.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Do you sculpt the head separately from the body?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
No. We decided to make it a snarl instead of a laugh on his
face. We also decided it would be better to go back to the
original look of Pinhead. Within the space of a fifteen day
job, he changed quite drastically.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
What kind of photographic reference did you have to work
from?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Normal stuff, like the Hellraiser Chronicles book and the
movie itself. I use freeze-frame a lot. There were a lot
of good photos in the book. I had the Hellraiser trading
cards, too.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Give us a little information on your sculpting technique.<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
I generally put off detailing as long as possible. The
longer you keep a sculpture in it's rough form, the better
the chance you have of getting good anatomy. Once you do
the detail, you fall in love with it and don't want to
change it.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
After you do the armature. do you make a naked man, with
musculature before you do the final layer with the leather.<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, that's exactly what I do. But Pinhead didn't get
complete legs, just the suggestion of legs. Then the folds
of the skirt were worked over that. A layer of Sculpey was
stretched over that to give the suggestion of musculature
showing through the leather costume.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Did you find it difficult to obtain a likeness of Doug
Bradley?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Frankly, I wish the likeness had been a bit better. I've
heard it commented that Tom Kuntz' likeness was better on
the first Pinhead, and I can't disagree. In terms of the
rest of it, I quite like it. I think the Pose is dramatic.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
I think that since the first Pinhead kit there has been more
information available about the details on the costume, such
as the leather piece on the back of the head, etc., so
that's all more accurate now.<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, so that was good. And I quite liked doing the altar of
souls.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Where did that idea come from?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
I think that was my idea. I saw the pillar of souls (in the
movie) and I liked the idea that the character of Pinhead
would have, something to relate to, instead of just relating
to a void. With all the Cenobites I've done, I tried to do
that to some extent, where the most obvious one being the
female, beckoning Butterball with that sort of
Flasher look to him. I wanted Pinhead to have something to
relate to, so the chains coming out of the box were supposed
to be stiffened and coming out straight at you. But not a
whole lot of people build it that way. A lot of the time,
they don't stiffen the chair. It's like that on the box,
but most people don't try to imitate that.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Did you do the one that is built and painted on the box?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
What kind of reference did you have to do the pillar of
souls?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Well, some of those reference pictures were provided by you.
I believe. Your pictures were great: they were a big help.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Did you do the mold work on the Pinhead?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, I did all the mold work on it. That was all done
fairly rapidly. In fact there's a crack that appears on his
chest that I never did have a chance to fix. It's kind of
frustrating because I usually spend a lot of time doing that
on other people's sculptures. But Overall. I think it's a
very minor frustration. I think it's a great piece. You
know what I think is a great idea with this kit?  To use
very small finishing nails on the hands. Pins seem to just
be too small and disappear against his hands.
<p>

<img src="luke_darth.jpg" width="193" height="144" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">
<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
What was the next project?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Actually the next one, Luke Skywalker, was begun prior to
Pinhead. It's taken three years to come out and it'll be
released in the next few weeks. The idea was all along to
have Luke positioned so that he could be fighting Darth
Vader. It got put off for one thing after another, and just
became a real nightmare. The Sculpey dried out and cracked.
It required a great deal of repair. In the process the face
got set to a point where I just couldn't change it anymore.
It wasn't quite right, but it got sent off to Lucas film
anyway and rejected. I had to entirely re-sculpt the head.
and it was rejected again because they didn't like the
expression on his face. They sent it back again, and I just
scraped the expression off his face. It was very
frustrating. I didn't think it was too bad. But eventually
they accepted the sculpture and the Luke Skywalker kit will
be out very soon.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Tell us a little about the Mars Attacks project.<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
We started with the 3 1/6th scale heads which became the
special limited edition three heads and a base resin kit.
Originally Mars Attacks was going to be a 1/6 scale Project.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
You mean with whole bodies and everything in 1/6 scale?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, it would have been huge. It would have been really
difficult to do dioramas in 1/6 scale. So, Dan found a guy
who could do those resin arms and legs which enabled us to
do the kits as 1/8 scale instead of 1/6. So, we switched
over and I sculpted three new heads in 1/8 scale.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
So the 1/6 heads were sort of an aborted attempt?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, and we had these three heads left over that we didn't
know what to do with, so Daniel suggested that I sculpt a
little Mars Attacks base and we offered them on little clear
acrylic rods as a special limited offer kit. So that's what
we did.
<p>

<img src="martian_ship.jpg" width="215" height="144" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">
<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
So you did all three Mars Attacks heads?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes: Tendril Face, the Attacking Martian, and the Flying
Saucer Martian. I also did the interior of the cockpit for
the Flying Saucer Martian kit. We had come up with the
outside of the saucer and it was going to be made in vinyl.
For manufacturing reasons, it had to be constructed in
meltable materials. So it had to be wax and meltable
plastics. Using metal washers and other found objects, I
would have to make little impromptu molds so that I could
create my washers out of sculpting wax so that they could
burn out. On Mars Attacks I did a lot of wax work, a lot of
finishing work, and a lot of radius work.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
What exactly is radius work?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
The vinyl pieces are made in metal molds and any fine lines
in the molds act as knife edges and actually cut the vinyl
pieces as they come out. So this is why the real hard edges
have to be cleaned out for vinyl casting. Because otherwise
the pieces will just get shredded as they come out of the
mold. Radiusing means going through all these cracks and
lines and so forth and making sure they have a rounded
(radiused) edge not a sharp edge.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
So how is that done?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
With the use of paint brushes and sculpting tools. Its done
first in the sculpture and then to the original waxes, at
every stage slowly and carefully refining. It's very time
consuming.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
So tell us, what was your next project for Screamin'?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Well, after that things slowed down for a little while.
Things on Mars Attacks stretched out for quite a while. In
fact, we're still doing things now, such as re-tooling.
We've had some complaints from people who've had difficulty
fitting the clear plastic domes over their heads. So, we're
re-tooling the helmets, making them a little bit bigger. So
people won't have that problem anymore.
<p>

<img src="demon.jpg" width="207" height="144" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">
<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Then what?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
After Luke Skywalker, I did a piece for an independent
company. It's a winged demon and a castle base. Also. I
did some Halloween projects. I still do installations for
an alternative music nightclub called QE II. This year I
did for them a 16 foot long bat skeleton, out of aluminum
foil and spray paint. I did it in a night and a day.
Compared to three years on the Luke Skywalker, that's
amazing.
(The name of Jeff's company is
<a href="../jeff_brower/index.html">Mystic Visions</a>. - Ed)
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
So did you do that on location?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
No. I made the bones at home and then went in one night
after closing and attached it to the wall. I have prior
pieces too. Our vampire got a coffin this year for the
first time. The werewolf got a little forest. Last year I
did a werewolf out of aluminum foil. I took a real cheesy
rubber werewolf mask and jazzed it up with new fangs and
reshaped it from the inside, and added lots of hair and gave
it glowing red eyes. The body itself was sculpted out of
aluminum foil and gaffer's tape. That sort of stuff is fun;
it's big and it happens fast.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
It gets your Halloween mood flowing.<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yeah, and one of the most interesting things about it is
that people will be seeing these things for the first time
without knowing that the person who did it was standing
right next to them. So you get this totally unedited
commentary about your work. This was a time when there were
a lot of changes happening at Screamin'. I started the
contracts for another job with the Bureau of Historic
Sights. I did a big model for them of a mansion. So that
kept me busy until February when we started the Dr. Channard
kit.
<p>

<img src="channard_body.jpg" width="129" height="216" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">
<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Tell us how that Progressed?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Well, I first did the design sketch and showed it to Richard
Hammecher and he liked it. Most Screamin' 1/4 scale kits
don't have bases. But because the tentacle is such an
integral part of the look of this character, this kit is
going to have a tentacle and a base.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
So how is that going to work?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
The back of one heel is going to touch the tentacle and the
base, to lend it some support. Other than that he'll be
raised up off the base. which is going to resemble the
chamber he comes out of in the movie.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Is it going to be all hollow vinyl?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
The base is going to be very thin, it'll look like just the
top of the chamber.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
So, are the bases going to be hollow vinyl like the Mars
Attacks bases?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes and no. The tentacle itself will be in segments. One
segment will be the torso head and top of the tentacle, all
in one piece. The base and the rest of the tentacle will be
in several pieces.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
So it will probably suggest in the instructions that you
should put some sort of weighted filler in the bottom of the
tentacle and the base?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, like plaster.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
And leave the body of the figure as lightweight as possible.<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, you could use aluminum foil or newspaper as filler. I
think aluminum foil is the next best thing since peanut
butter. I use it a lot.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
What kind of reference did you have for the sculpture of
Channard?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
I had very little reference for Channard. I had the films,
and the pictures from the Hellraiser Chronicles. He's going
to have his arms outstretched with the little tentacles
coming from the palms of his hands. It's definitely the
most detailed of all the Cenobite kits so far.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Do you feel you got a good likeness to the Characters?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, I think so. The likeness to the actor is really not as
important as the likeness to the make-up. His whole face
changed in the makeup, the deformity from the wires, etc.
In fact down around his nostrils, the laugh lines in a
normal person goes up above the nostrils, but his follow the
make-up. So you have to sculpt the make-up, not the actor.
In that regard, I think it's coming out great.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
When do you expect to finish this pieces<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
I hope to have it finished in two weeks. Then we'll have to
go through the production process, the molding. etc. So the
chronology of release will probably be: Luke Skywalker,
Michael Meyers, then Dr. Channard.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Can you tell us what the next projects will be?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Only generally. We are going after several licenses and I'm
quite excited about some of them. We've discussed doing
more Hellraiser kits. My feeling is that the sophistication
in the model kit market has really grown since the beginning
of Screamin'. I think we have to play catch-up a little
bit. I think we need to find ways to have a little more
variety in how we do things. We need to continue what has
been begun with things like the new Pinhead and the Mars
Attacks dioramas, to have things be a little more complex
than just a figure standing there. Channard is a step in
this direction with the base. I think you'll see more
things like that. We are also discussing doing original
designs. The particulars of that have not been worked out
yet, but I think somewhere within the next three or four
releases, you'll see something like that.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
One last question. Have you seen the Netherworld Dr.
Channard kit?<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes. I've seen it. It's a beautiful sculpture. I loved
the base; ours is not going to be anywhere near that
elaborate. I think it's very dramatic, but Paul doesn't
have to conform to some of the same standards I have to.
Ours is a licensed kit and has to go through an approval
process as well as the fact that ours is a vinyl kit and has
certain production factors to content with. I think they're
going to be very different things. I hope that anyone who
has the Netherworld one will be wanting ours as well. I
believe Screamin' and Netherworld are on two very different
scales. I think the challenge to sculpting Cenobites is
that as cool as they are in the movies, that they really
don't do very much compared to a superhero character or an
action character. The Cenobites are subdued, so it's hard
to come up with dynamic poses. One thing we have discussed
is a 1/6 scale Pinhead.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, I've seen photographs in a Japanese magazine of
Kaiyodo's 1/6 scale Pinhead.<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, but we don't like that sculpture. In fact I have a
design sketch for a 1/6 Pinhead of my own. It has a diorama
background with a pillar, with lots of chains and corpses
hanging off it.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
Well. I hope that gets produced.<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
Yes, you'll have to wait and see.
<p>

<img src="em.gif" alt="EM:" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="15">
I'm looking forward to it. Thank you for your time.<br>
<img src="jb.gif" alt="JB:" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="15">
You're welcome, Ed.
