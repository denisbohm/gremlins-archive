&quot;One thing nice about egotists:
they don't talk about other people&quot;</b>

Greetings earthlings! You hold in your hands
issue #19 of KitBuilders Magazine. This time
we're going to get a little spacey, as you can tell
from this issue's cover, which was beautifully constructed
in cyberspace by Mike James. Mike
used Masudaya's YM-3 (Lost in Space Robot) as
his starting point and then created his own version
of an extraterrestrial terrain.
<p>
Jean Elliott is back again with a piece on
space related kits. John Tucky (that big &quot;People's
Choice&quot; winner at this year's Mad Model Party
show) is your tour guide through the universe of
creating your very own Invaders diorama scene.
Does he stop there? Oh no! He transverses the
cosmos even more and brings you his building
and painting tips for Billiken's Gort and Klaatu.
<p>
Joe Jobe changes mediums and switches
from vinyl to styrene (&quot;Plastic Injection&quot;). This
issue he gives his pros and cons on Halcyon's
Predator 2 kit. He also includes his ever popular
customizing tips for this piece.
<p>
Rich Larson gets stoned. Well, really, he
shows us how to achieve a stone like effect on
your kit. And being the ever helpful guy that he is
he also shares his flesh tone painting tips. Both
of these styles are demonstrated by using an airbrush.
<p>
For those of you who were unable to attend
this year's Wonderfest, we're going to give you a
glimpse of what you missed. This show keeps getting
bigger and better each year.
<p>
We sent Ed Bowkley out to wander the
aisles of the various east coast shows. His mission:
to record what your thoughts really are
about this hobby. His first stop was the spring
Chiller Show in Secaucus, New Jersey. Ed titles
his piece, &quot;We The People.&quot;
<p>
Don't forget the &quot;Cool New&quot; section for cool
new releases, Rich Larson's kit reviews and that
wonder of the west coast, Mark Paskell and his
California Connection.
Enjoy!
