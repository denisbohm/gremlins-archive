We were very surprised and pleased to have been
presented this award by Mr. Paul Antonelli (The
Character Shop) at the recent Boston Modelfest. We
were also happy to share this award with Amazing
Figure Modeler Magazine. Our thanks to you, the readers.
For this award was based on magazine sales,
requests, customer's comments and feedback from
both The Character Shop and Gremlins in the Garage.
It is very much appreciated.

A monstrous hello to issue #20. First I would like
to apologize for this issue not turning out quite as we
planned. Our main monster article did not materialize
as we had hoped. So we had to put in a last minute
replacement. We also made a last minute cover
change. This issue's cover shows R &amp; R Studio's unique
Midnight Bride plaque. (You can read more about this
piece in our &quot;Cool New Stuff Section&quot;.)
<p>
When we needed someone to cover the third
annual Mad Model Party we went to the man with the
gargantuan personality, our own Mark Paskell. You can
read his Captivating commentary in this issue's
&quot;California Connections&quot;. Followed by a photo review kindly
supplied to us by show promoters, SideShow Inc.
<p>
You won't find John Tucky (&quot;Xacto Facto&quot;) sitting
on his accolades, (which could be painful). He was busy
writing this issue's crushing article about Rodan and an
unfortunate factory complex. Once again he'll be you
step by step tour guide through this extensive diorama.
<p>
Wayne &quot;The Dane&quot; Hansen is not afraid of Death.
In fact he bends it to his will. Well, to be more clear he
takes Halcyon's Judge Death kit and repositions it more
to his liking.
<p>
Jean Elliott had to break out those National
Geographic's Serenqeti photo articles to help in painting
Eerie Cast Models', hodge podge of animal parts,
Conglomeron. (You won't find this one in a petting zoo.)
<p>
Steve &quot;midnight&quot; Mollett knows a thing or two
about bondage. Reproducing scale manacles and
shackles that is. We thought this was a great non-figure,
but related, article to share. After all what would
that dungeon scene be without realistic looking &quot;irons&quot;
hanging from the wall.
<p>
Never let it be said that Rich Larson is a predictable
kind of guy. Last issue he showed you some airbrush
painting tips, this issue he shows you how an airbrush
works. Heck anybody can teach vou in the normal way.
Don't forget to check out Rich's kit reviews and
our photo highlight of this past summer's Chiller
Theatre show.
<p>
ONCE AGAIN WE POKE SOME FUN AT OURSELVES AND THE HOBBY!
IF LIFE IS TOTALLY SERIOUS
TO YOU THEN WE SUGGEST YOU SKIP THIS SECTION.
EVERYTHING ON THESE LAMPOON PAGES ARE TO BE
TAKEN AS INTENDED, AS A JOKE!! ENJOY!
