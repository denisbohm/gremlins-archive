The recasting of kits, a welcome
alternative to budget minded
modelers, or a growing cancer for
the hobby?
<p>
Of course, as with any confrontation,
you have your two
opposing camps. Those who like it
and encourage it, and those who are
dead set against it.  Whether you
have yet to even give this topic a
second thought, rest assured that if
you plan on being a part of this
hobby for any length of time you
will find that it will effect you either
one way or another.  Perhaps in your
opinion it might be in a good way
by being able to increase your collection
by acquiring kit copies at
lower prices.  Or perhaps you might
be effected by sculptors and producers
dropping out of the hobby due to
having their kits being copied and
sold. (We already have sculptors
tell us that they were thinking of
leaving behind the &quot;garage kit&quot;
hobby for a more lucrative and safer
career with established curio and
statue type shops.)
<p>
Of course on the flip side it is
tough to chastise your average modeler
that just wants an affordable
piece that he can build and paint.
After all he got into this hobby for
fun and relaxation, not to feel guilty
or pass judgment on another.  That's
what makes this recasting issue so
difficult.  Both sides can present
convincing arguments to one extent or
another.  That is why we are presenting
the following, to get you to give this
topic some thought.  After all it is
YOUR hobby, and you should know what
is going on in it.

<b>EDITOR'S NOTE:</b>
<i>
KitBuilders played
devil's advocate with George Stephenson
of GEOmetric Design, a leading
proponent for the curtailing of
recast kits. We presented Mr.
Stephenson a list of questions that
were based on similar type questions
and comments that we have heard
and read from various hobby members.
</i>

<p>
<b>
1) What's the big deal if an &quot;out of
production&quot; kit gets recast?
</b>
<p>
Ask Kim its that question. Kim produced
some very nice garage kits a
few years ago (Green Hornet and
Kato) and was so upset about bootleggers
recasting his work that he
not only stopped producing his excellent
castings of those figures but for
the most part dropped out of the
hobby altogether. Believe me. Kim is
not the only person who has become
disenchanted with this.
<p>
Many of your readers would argue
that recasting an &quot;out of production&quot; kit
is a victimless crime. The problem with
that kind of thinking is that if we condone
that activity,
the opportunist
will rationalize
and justify bootlegging anything.
Where does it
stop if we say it
is OK to recast
the Aurora kits,
then what about
the MPC Alien?
What about the
Billiken Ymir? Screamin's first
Pinhead? GEOmetric's Teenage
Werewolf or Tremors? What about
Horizon's Frankenstein or Wolf Man?
All of these kits are out of production.
What if one of these companies
had plans to re-release a discontinued
kit (e.g., our original resin
Pumpkin-headJ. GEOmetric could
sure use the money those additional
sales would provide. Why should
some lazy, unethical opportunist profit
from the legitimate hard work my
partner and I do?
 To put it in the most simplistic
terms possible, recasting someone's
work is unfair to the person or persons
responsible for creating it and
it is illegal.
<p>
<b>
2) If a kit has a limited run of only
50 to 100 pieces, don't you feel
that it is asking to end up being
recast?
</b>
<p>
If your magazine has a print run of
5000 copies, is it right or fair for
some other publisher to come along
and print another 1500 without your
permission just because you are sold
out? In a niche industry like ours,
with such a limited consumer base,
recasting a kit is even more harmful.
<p>
But think about this; I hear people
talk about &quot;such and such&quot; company
being in the hobby &quot;just for the
money&quot; as opposed to being in it &quot;for
the love of the hobby&quot;. A garage kit
producer who produces only 50 or
100 kits of a particular subject is not
&quot;doing it just for the money&quot;; he isn't
making a whole lot of money with
those numbers, especially if the kit is
licensed. So the guy who bootlegs
that kit as really sticking it to someone
who loves this hobby and wants
to share with other modelers. The
bootlegger doesn't give a damn about
the hobby. All he cares about is himself.
<p>
<b>
3) Don't you think the current standard
pricing that has kits automatically starting
at $100 and
up just fuels
the recasting
market? Your
average modeler
would much
rather go home
from a show
with two or
three recast
kits for his
money than just one original?
</b>
<p>
If kit producers were selling 1000
kits of each subject, or even 500,
they could lower those prices. The
fact is, most of the producers are
not selling as many as 150 kits of a
character. 150 kits is a good number
of sales for a typical garage kit. From
all of the people in this hobby I have
gotten to know, it is obvious that few
garage kit companies are selling 150
copies of their resin kits. If the company
is using good sculptors and providing
packaging with box art and
instructions and paying royalties, it is
very difficult to make any money on
150 kits. . .even at $100 per kit. Do
the math:
<p>
<table border="1" bgcolor="#ffffff">
<tr><td><b>Gross Sales</b>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;$15,000 (150 kits x $100)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Total Costs</b>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;$7860</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Original Sculpture&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;$3000 (very cheap if you use the guys we use)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Licensing Guarantee&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;$2500 (not many good licenses at this price)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Original Box art and instructions&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;$250 (very cheap for good artists)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Box art and instruction copies&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;$150 ($1 per kit x 150 kits)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Boxes&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;$150 ($1 per kit x 150 kits)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Resin&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;$1125 ($7.50 each 1/6 scale kit with small base)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Molds&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;$400 (per five gallons of RTV)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Labor for moldmaking&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;$95 (minimum wage of $4.75 x 20 hours)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;Labor for resin pouring&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;$190 (minimum wage of 4.75 x 40 hours)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Net</b>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;$7140</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
What I have not included here is liability insurance required by most
licensors at about $2000 per year),
advertising in magazines, mailing flyers to mailing list people and
traveling to conventions. All of these are necessary to move 150
kits of a typical garage kit character in a year; it took us two
years to move that many of our Tremors kit, even with our
distribution network. Further, I have estimated all of these
costs on the low end; most of these costs will be higher; and
who wants to work for minimum wage? At $100 per kit, the
producers are not making much money, if any. Those who
are hitting that 150 kit per year plateau are discounting to
some of their customers (stores and dealers) at between
30 percent and 50 percent.
<p>
To answer your question, yes, I think the high price of some
kits helps to fuel the recasting market. I think there are a lot
of kits that are overpriced for what they are, i.e. unlicensed
and without any significant packaging. Most of GEOmetric's
resin kits have been marketed below $100 and we provide
color box art, instructions and pay royalties. But we have had
two of our vinyl &quot;Trek&quot; kits which sell for $49.99 bootlegged
by The Universal Armorer in resin and sold for $40. We have
also had our &quot;Trek&quot; kits bootlegged by Elfin. Those kits aren't
overpriced. And, the high price of some kits is not the only
reason these guys are bootlegging. They are lazy, greedy, and
opportunistic; they apparently don't have the talent or the
intelligence or the business acumen to create their own kits.
<p>
I must also say I disagree that the average modeler would
rather go home with two or three recasts for his money than
with one original. Perhaps we are the minority (I don't think
so) but the people I talk to are more ethical and principled
than that and have a more far-sighted view of where this
hobby is headed and what it can become. I think the majority
of people in this hobby love the hobby and can see the
wrong and the harm in bootlegging. The jerks are in the
minority.
<p>
<b>
4) The quality of most recasts out there today match their
originals So why not go for one that is cheaper?
</b>
<p>
I have examined recasts of GEOmetric kits and there is no
way anyone could honestly say that the quality matches the
original. The pieces do not fit together as well as the original;
because the recast is a copy of a copy, loss of detail and
shrinkage are unavoidable. I'll admit that I have seen some
pretty impressive recasts but none are as good as the original.
The majority of recasts are pretty weak in quality in my
opinion, and I can envision first time buyers or beginning
modelers getting suckered into buying a recast and being
turned off to the hobby because of the poor quality.
<p>
<b>
5) Do you think most modelers really care who sculpted a
kit, or if it's a limited run or licensed? They just want a nice
kicking piece that they can build and paint. It's not worth
it to them to spend the extra money just to say it was
sculpted by &quot;so and so,&quot; or they have #1 out of say 50,
etc.
</b>
<p>
As a modeler I have never bought a kit just because it was
the work of a certain sculptor or because it was one of a limited
number. I buy a kit because the sculpt and design are of
good quality, the price is right, and the character appeals to
me. If a kit isn't good enough to make me smile, I can probably
do without it. I buy kits to build them, not to sell them a
few years from now at a profit. I don't care how many have
been produced but if I am lucky enough to get a rare or limited
edition kit of a character I like, that makes me smile,
too. Believe me, that kit is going to be built and painted and,
except in rare cases, I will do the building and painting for
myself. That's what I like to do in my spare time.
<p>
<b>
6) Say a kit is next to impossible to find. Or its price tag is
outrageous. Do you think that it is OK to deny a modeler a
chance to own even a copy of a kit that they absolutely
want?
</b>
<p>
I have had conversations with individuals at conventions
who have asked me this question. In fact, I spent a long time
talking to a gentleman at the Louisville Wonderfest and then
again at the Chiller Theatre Expo. He told me a friend of his
wanted to buy his Teenage Werewolf in order to recast it for
himself and about 20 of his friends. Apparently, they had
taken up the hobby after GEOmetric discontinued the kit. The
gentleman said he felt it was unfair that his late-arriving
friend was denied the opportunity to get an original. We
discussed the issue for about 45 minutes.
<p>
I explained to him that there are a few kits I have been trying
to find for over four years (Mike Trcic's Darkness, Scoop's
Twilight Zone Gremlin, and Kaiyodo's Enemy Mine Drac). I
have had the opportunity to purchase bootlegs of these kits
but there is no way I would ever do so. I may never be able
to get these kits but I'd rather do without than to support
someone who is ripping off the makers of the originals. For
me, part of the fun of collecting and building these kits is finding
them. After discussing the issue at length we shook
hands. I appreciated the fact that he was man enough to
come talk to me (rather than rumor-mongering and back
stabbing) and the fact that he cared enough about how
GEOmetric might feel to ask if we would mind. Of course, we
would be very upset if the kit were recasted, even more so
since we have been discussing a reissue of that kit with the
licenser.
<p>
<b>
7) Will this push to ban recasting result in a &quot;resin police
force&quot; appearing at model shows?
</b>
<p>
GEOmetric will not be a part of any &quot;resin police force&quot; at
conventions or anywhere else. There would be no need for a
resin police force if bootleggers would turn their energies
toward creating their own original works. Don't bootleg the
Twilight Zone Gremlin, produce a new one. Don't bootleg our
Unnamable or Tremors kits; produce your own Unnamable
or Tremors. As far as I am concerned, GEOmetric does not
need a resin police force to protect it at conventions. We are
so angry about bootlegs of our kits that a bootlegger of our
kits will need a police force to protect him from us if we catch
him selling that stuff at a convention.
<p>
This is our business and our livelihood. This hobby helps
support our families and the families of the people we
employ. We are prepared to deal with anyone who threatens
our business. If someone is bootlegging kits by our competitors,
that is a problem our competitors have to deal with.
However, I will be the first person to call our competitors to
let them know who is bootlegging their kits. Some of the tactics
we have recently employed are threatening to file criminal
charges (copyright and/or trademark infringement) with
the U.S. Attorney's Office; filing a complaint with the Secretary
of State in the bootlegger's home state and having the State
Department of Revenue investigate his business; filing a civil
suit in federal court and seeking statutory damages; alerting
other copyright holders as to the bootlegger's infringement
on their properties. We will do whatever it takes.
<p>
<b>
8) Would this anti recasting attitude be as much a big deal
if it was the larger retail companies offering recast kits
rather than the little guys?
</b>
<p>
If large companies were offering recasts of our kits, we'd
be in court immediately. We'd have to be because if the little
recasters are hurting us land they are because the marketplace
is so limited) a large company could kill small producers
like GEOmetric, Horizon and Screaming
<p>
<b>
9) Have you ever had a recast in your own collection. and
did you like it any less because it was not an original?
</b>
<p>
I have one recast that I know of in my collection. It is a
recast of the Scoop SpiderHead Thing. I purchased the kit
in 1990 and had no idea that it was a recasted Japanese
kit. I thought it was an American kit (remember we did not
have the hobby publications that we have today keeping modelers
informed about what's new, where to get it and who
makes it). I was thrilled with it when I got it and immediately
built and painted it. But in 1993, I went to Japan and met
Mr. Kosaka, the sculptor of the Scoop kits. I saw his original
and noticed a dramatic difference in size and detail. Mine
must be about a fourth generation recast. I still have the kit
in my collection but it is not as satisfying now that I have seen
the original and know that mine is a recast. In 1991, I traded
a GEOmetric kit for a Scoop Terminator, again not knowing
it was a recast. The casting was pretty bad and I lost
interest in the kit when I realized it was a recast and how
much work I would have to put in to get it built and painted.
I never built it and was about to throw the thing away last
year when an acquaintance said he'd like it. I gave it to him.
<p>
<b>
10) Do you really think that the effort to ban recasting will
ever truly succeed?
</b>
<p>
Can we stop bootlegging completely? No, I don't think we
will ever do that. Guys who don't have any integrity or scrap
pies, will always look for what they think is an easy buck. They
don't care who they hurt as long as they get what they want.
The only way to get them to stop is to make them under-
stand that the risks outweigh whatever temporary gains they
perceive. My concern, first and foremost is GEOmetric and
protecting GEOmetric's interests. Where our interests overlap
with those of other kit producers, I am more than happy
to help.
<p>
Can we protect ourselves and the hobby from the ruin that
rampant recasting can bring? We have to.

<b>EDITOR'S NOTE:</b> <i>Here are some additional letters that make
some good points.</i>
<p>
From: Al Reboiro
<p>
For some time the issue of recasting has been coming to
a head. I feel if your rights have been violated and one of your
kits has been recasted, everything in your power should be
done to correct the situation. Everyone agrees with this, as
they should; it's only common sense. What does not make
sense is that for years even the most hard core opponents
of recasting have maintained that vintage kits were the only
exception to the rule. Now it appears the rules have
changed.
<p>
Being a collector of vintage kits and a producer of vintage
recasts, I now find myself lumped in with the hated recasters.
Let me say that what I do is in no way, shape or form
illegal. Let me make my point with the Aurora Bride of
Frankenstein:
<ol>
<li>The copyright on the model has expired.
<li>Aurora, being out of business, will not renew the copyright.
<li>The molds for the kit are not owned by any model
company and are most likely nonexistent.
</ol>
Companies like
Playing Mantis can now buy a kit, have steel molds made,
copyright the kit and issue it in styrene. Is Playing Mantis a
recaster? The worst I can do is have another unlicensed kit.
<p>
I have always thought the idea of a resin police was a bad
one. But now it seems we have resin vigilantes. What's
next? The resin Gestapo? Will we have a resin BIG BROTHER
watching us?
<p>
<b>
Al Reboiro
</b>

<hr size="1">
From: Mike James / Azimuth Design
<p>
I've been asked to contribute a few words about the
recasting issue. As a sculptor and marketer of my own kits,
this is a subject of significant concern to me.
<p>
First of all, in my mind there are two types of recasting.
Those reproducing old kits that are out of production (where
the original artist or company that produced the kit will probably
not get hurt), and those recasters that recast kits CURRENTLY
being marketed by the creators. It's this second
group I'm addressing.
<p>
To this second group, I have a few words to say. you
guys are the scum of the earth! (Ahh! I feel better already.)
You talentless fools hide behind the repeated slogan that you
are in it to give the customer the cheapest price. What a
load of bu11#@%*! You're in it for the cheaters buck. If you
cared a wit about &quot;customers&quot; as you claim, you would
replace defective kits. You'd be happy to provide ANY form
of service to your customers like legit marketers do. But
your typical refrain is &quot;All sales are final&quot;. Pieces missing,
doesn't matter. Air bubbles the size of peas, seam lines
requiring a belt sander, tough.
Many hobbyists aren't
aware of all that goes into
producing a kit. This is
crucial to understanding
why recasting is such an
issue, so here goes a brief
run-dawn. We're talking
MONTHS to sculpt a piece to production quality. Note, that's
Months&quot; of work without ANY PAY. Think about it, cause that's
the big one. Then, besides hundreds, if not thousands of dollars
fronted on RTV rubber resin, and packing, a marketer
must advertise, hundreds of dollars more. So, generally the
first 30 or 50 kits sold are just trying to make back the losses
of sculpting and advertising. We may be talking 6 months
before the first penny of profit.
<p>
No such worries for the recaster. No sculpting time to
recover, no advertising $ to spend. The real creator's are
paying that for him. All the recaster does is get his hands on
one kit, make a mold and sell. No talent, no work, no marketing,
no money invested, just rip-off someone else's work.
The process of getting a kit PREPARED for market is almost
everything. it is exhausting and expensive. To get a kit prepared
sometimes feels like going 15 rounds with Tyson. To
be confronted with a recaster then, is like having some bloated
bum in the crowd challenge you as you're crawling out of
Tyson's ring. Despicable.
<p>
This kind of thing can kill a small, honest resin producing
business. I recognized that from the beginning, and that
if I were to do kits, I was going to invent my own characters
and get Copyrights and Trademarks to protect myself from
recasters. That costs me an additional $500 per kit and a
week of unpaid work. And, if I didn't have to do this, my kits
could be cheaper. Unfortunately there are a lot of kits produced
that are NOT properly licensed and these sculptors
are open to recasting without defense, i.e. they cannot sue
a recaster.
<p>
I get reminded by folks that this entire garage kit industly
got it's beginnings with SCULPTORS practicing unlicensed,
guerrilla-style kit production. True enough. But, I
want to highlight two important &quot;moral distinctions&quot; between
the infringements of guerrilla sculptors, and what recasters
do.
<p>
One. With sculptors, you have a talented person actualIy
creating an original piece of art from scratch, with all the
work this entails. He is investing something precious, his
time, money, and creativity. A recaster on the other hand
invests NOTHING, and produces nothing original. It baffles
me that somehow, recasters delude themselves to thinking
they are legitimate members of the kit industry. Further baffling
to me is that many hobbyists believe this too. I actually
had someone call up my company and ask me where they
could get a cheap recast of my kit, apparently neither cognizant
of the insult or the downright illegality of their request.
<p>
Secondly, the &quot;sculptor's&quot; licensing-infringement victim is
typically a big, rich movie or television studio. (I think it is safe
to say Paramount is not going into Chapter 11 because
some guy with taped-up glasses in Big Wipe, Idaho is making
a kit of Sulu.) Recasters, on the other hand, are not ripping
off a wealthy, faceless company, the recaster's ripping off the
taped-glasses guy! Someone who CAN be driven into Chapter
11. I am aware that legally, there is no difference, infringement
is infringement. But morally, it's the difference between
stealing a Tic-Tac from a wealthy person, and stealing clothing
from a homeless
person.
<p>
What many hobbyists don't get is that
even the larger kit companies are MORE like
the guy with taped-up
glasses than like Paramount Studios. These little companies
make fragile profits. And contrary to popular belief, NOBODY
makes a &quot;killing&quot; at this, at least not yet. It's a very personal,
low profit, entrepreneurial thing, mostly done out of love for
kits.
<p>
This entire industry is small, fragile, and personal. That's
why I love it... anybody can join in. That is partly why predators
(small p) such as recasters are so dangerous to it. Left
unchecked, recasters could kill the entire industry the same
way they kill a budding young company.
<p>
Simply, it's like this. Here's how kit companies typically
start - Imagine YOURSELF, loving kits so much, YOU decide
to sculpt your first kit. you spend months working on it with
loving care, you buy advertising, and you proudly put it out on
the market, hoping to make back some of the money you
spent. But, a week later someone else knocks off your kit and
is selling it $25 cheaper. Poof... you can't get an order.
Now, ...tell me you will do a SECOND kit. No way. The seedling
is squashed. A potential company, closed. Your vision, and
the great new kits you might have produced will never see the
light of day. The effect of recasting is that simple.
<p>
<b>
Mike James<br>
Azimuth Design
</b>
<p>
<b>EDITOR'S NOTE:</b> <i>KitBuilder's has recently learned that Mike
James' Azimuth Design &quot;Bride&quot; kit, first advertised in print as
recently as our last issue, is now being recast in Asia only a
month after its release. The selling price of the recast is
$99. 50 as opposed to the legitimate Azimuth Design price
of $125. The recasts are reportedly poor in quality. with
large chips in the resin, ground flat areas, and soft detail. All
accessory parts are missing, there is no Certificate of
Authenticity, Instructions, Painting tips, or Flip Book, and it as
being sold without protective packing. It does however still
retain Mike James' signature on the base.
<p>
Mike knows who the recaster is because he individually
marks all of his kits. He is having to interrupt production of
a new kit to pursue prosecution. Mike's biggest concern is
the poor quality of the recasts, and with his name being
duplicated on the base some may blame him for it. As Mike
said, &quot;At least if they're gonna' rip me off, I wish they'd have
the courtesy to do a good job. &quot;
<p>
Another negative result of this incidence was that Mike
had to turn down a very large order. A man wanted to order
one of every kit that Mike has produced so far. The man said
he would like to receive them before he left for Singapore.
Well, Singapore is where Mike's &quot;Bride&quot; kit is being reproduced.
He did not want to risk having his whole line being
recast, so he turned the man down. Now the guy could have
been perfectly legitimate, but Mike felt he could not take the
risk. Mike said, &quot;If recasting did not exist, both of us would
be happy instead of miserable. &quot; This is a good example of one
of the negative sides to recasting.

<li>You spend the time, money, and effort to produce your
own kit. Within a few months of its release you find unauthorized
copies of it for sale at a show. Would you be
upset, or just accept it as being a part of doing business
in this hobby?

<li>Do you feel that if the easy availability of recast kits
continues will it hurt or help this hobby to grow?
