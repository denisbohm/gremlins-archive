Hi! The fact that issue #17 was declared a sell-out
after just three weeks of its December release pretty
much showed us what you, the readers, choose as your
favorite kit subject. Now monsters are still scary and
Sci-Fi still flies high and superheroes have the muscle,
but even all together they can't compare with the
female form as the preferred topic for builders and
painters. Now a few might deem this sexist, but we prefer
to call it praise. It would be a very boring world without
them (ladies). (And probably an unpopulated world,
unless man learned how to self reproduce. But we
would rather not think about that.)
<p>
This issue's cover of Graphitti Designs' Vampirella
(originally sculpted by Clayburn Moore) was expertly
modified and painted by that &quot;ladies man,&quot; Mike James
of Azimuth Design. The
&quot;<a href="babylon_beauty.html"><b>Babylon Beauty</b></a>&quot;
Monique Gabrielle, (sculpted by Joe Laudati) in the lower left corner,
was built and painted by Jean Elliott. You can decipher
how he did it by reading his article in this issue.
<p>
Mike Fredericks (&quot;Garage Gals&quot;) gives us a look at
some of the many female kits that have been produced
in the last thirty years. We also threw in an additional
photo review of more vintage and newer female related
kits.
<p>
Speaking of photo reviews, Jerry Shaw sent us
photos of his visit to Japan's Wonderfest Show. You'll
see that it is quite obvious what subject is the most
popular with Japanese modelers.
<p>
Joe Jobe gives us the scoop on Polydata's Luke
Skywalker figure. Plus two more pieces get reviewed for
his &quot;Vinyl Vignettes.&quot;
<p>
If you ask John Tucky (&quot;Xacto Facto&quot;) the time, he'll
tell you how to build a clock - clock tower display base
that is.
<p>
Rich Larson (&quot;Some Assembly&quot;) tries to set things
straight, with a leaning Worf kit. His &quot;In My Opinion&quot; has
a batch of kits for your &quot;re-viewing&quot; pleasure.
<p>
Denis Lainesse of Figure FX Productions gives us
a preview sample article from his new upcoming book,
&quot;How To Build Fabulous Figures of Film and Fantasy.&quot;
<p>
Let's not forget the &quot;California Connection,&quot; and
much, much more.<br>
<b>ENJOY!</b>
<p>
<i>
P.S. Opps! We forgot to mention that last issue's
Betty Page cover kit was built and painted by our own
John Tucky.
</i>
<p>
<i>
Also we had a typo with G-Force's phone number
in last issue's &quot;Cool New Stuff&quot; section. The correct
phone number is (519) 853-3679.
