A &quot;super&quot; hello and welcome to issue #21.
I am sure most of us got into this hobby for the
fun and temporary escapism it can bring from
the &quot;real world&quot; problems. Well even a hobby has
a serious topic, and for this one it's
<a href="recasts.html"><b>recast kits</b></a>.
This debate of what's good and what's bad has
really escalated in the last half of this year. So
far it appears that both sides are very committed
to what they feel is good for the hobby, or good
for the hobbyist. You the consumer, the &quot;heart&quot;
of this hobby, needs to be aware of this controversy
and decide how you want things to be
done. No matter which side you are for, remember
if you just sit back and say nothing don't bitch
later if things didn't turn out as you would
have liked.
<p>
Ok, back to the escapism. For this issues
theme we bowed to those mighty superheroes.
Our &quot;Olympian&quot; <b>cover photo</b> was done by <b>Larry
Smith</b> of California. He used Horizon's Thor for
this outdoor shot. (The clouds are cotton.)
<p>
Matt McWhirt &quot;rings up&quot; another controversial
subject, kit pricing. Matt tries to show you just
how much can go into producing an average kit.
<p>
Ed Bowkley pulls double duty this issue. First he
gives us his personal review of the Boston
Monster Modelfest. [Thanks to Paul Antonelli and
Rich Larson for additional photos.] Then he hit
the road again to the October Chiller Theatre
show for his &quot;We The People&quot; article. He's a man
not afraid to ask questions! (There is also a
Chiller photo spread following Ed's article.)
Speaking of questions, John Tucky had some to
ask of sculptor Pat Delaney. His answers can be
found in this issues Xacto Facto.
<p>
Seems people are full of questions, for Rich
Larson had a bunch to ask popular personality
Brinke Stevens. She was happy to fill Rich in
about her new &quot;Brinke of Destruction&quot; kit. Being
produced by Creatures Unlimited of England. Rich
also reviews five pages of new kits, (&quot;In My
Opinion&quot;).
<p>
Mark Paskell, that golden tanned thespian
(no, I said thespian), once again fills us in on
that ever changing California scene.
<p>
That vinyl master, Joe Jobe, was certainly busy
this issue. Lending his critiquing eye and tweaking
touch to four new kits. Check out his &quot;Vinyl
Vignettes&quot; and Ben Kenobi article.
<p>
Well we finally crammed in a few pages for our
&quot;Collector's Corner&quot;. Where readers get to show
off their work. ENJOY!!
