 Greetings and welcome to issue #6. First on
a sad note I would like to dedicate this issue to
two long time friends that passed on many many
years before they should have. Val Sakne and
Larry Adarns are two guys that I worked with
for over 16 years. They were two of a few
reasons that made those 16 years bearable. It will
be tough to turn around at party or
camping/canoe trip and not expect to see them.
You left behind alot of friends guys, so save
some room at the bar.
<p>
Now I would like to run by you again the
&quot;Publishers Plea&quot;. Please!, if you are a
subscriber and have changed your address, or are
planning on moving, please, please let the
magazine know. With every issue we receive a
call or letter from a subscriber that said they
never received the last issue. When we check it
out we find out they moved. The K.B.G.S. is
mailed out 3rd class. 3rd class mail is not
forwarded!! (It gets thrown away) This is just a
waste of time and money. Our job is to keep you,
the reader, informed, and all we ask is that you
inform us if you change your address. (A simple
19 cent postcard will do.)
<p>
Ok, I'm done whining now, please enjoy this
issue.
<p>
GORDY! ! !
<p>
Last Minute Whine: Be sure to include
&quot;lot&quot; numbers, or &quot;apart ment&quot; numbers, etc. in
your address. This is very important for third
class mail.
