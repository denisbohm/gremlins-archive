Welcome to issue #16, our tribute
issue to ol' fire breath himself, Godzilla.
We hope that this issue does not end up as
a eulogy for the green guy, but the rumors
are out there. Perhaps this will be like the
Superman &quot;dies&quot; hoopla. We can only hope.
<p>
This issue's cover is courtesy of John
Tucky's building and photo prowess. You
can read how John created this towering
diorama in his &quot;Exacto Facto&quot; column in this
issue.
<p>
To give you an idea of some of the
Godzilla kits that are available out there,
Paul Gill, and <a href="daves_world.html"><b>Dave Barker</b></a>,
sent in some
photos of their collections. John Carlson
(Monstrosities) also tries to update us on
the future of our favorite giant lizard.
<p>
Mark Paskell (&quot;California Connection&quot;)
lays a &quot;bite&quot; of praise on a true horror
movie legend, Bela Lugosi. Plus he gives us
a seventh row center look at some of the
major movies being planned in Hollywood.
<p>
Rich Larson goes back to one of his
favorite hobby topics, painting. This issue
he uses a new Nosferatu kit as his subject
matter. Speaking of painting, Tommy Ellis
[Tom &amp; Jerry Studio] and Jean Elliott
share with us some of their painting tips on
a Pumpkinhead &amp; Beach Blanket Beastie
kit, respectively.
<p>
Alfred Florez took a one dimensional
movie memory and made it into a three
dimensional display piece. How he tamed
this beast can be found in this issue.
<p>
We are trying to play catch-up with the
many &quot;Collectors Corner&quot; photos that you
send in. So we tried to cram as many as
space allowed in this issue. Enjoy!
<p>
KitBuilders would like to apologize to Cargos
Sendra for accidentally omitting his name
from the Chiller Theatre photo review last
issue. Carlos was the one that took those
great photos that we ran.
