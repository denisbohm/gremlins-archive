Hi!  Happy Holidays and
Welcome to KitBuilders
Magazine issue #9. You might
have noticed a few changes. First
off, we have included a color cover
and an upgrade in our paper stock.
We hope that this will give the magazine
a more &quot;polished&quot; look, plus
help improve photo clarity and advertisement
reproduction.
<p>
Some of you might also have
noticed the omission of the word
&quot;Gluesniffers&quot; from the magazine
title. Well we thought it was time for
a change. As this hobby grows so
does the magazine, and we feel that
leaving the &quot;Gluesniffers&quot; on the
cover would limit this growth. No,
we have not sold out, or submitted
to the minority (three angry letters
in three years) that expressed
loathing towards the magazine
title. The basic idea (which was
started in issue #1) of this publication
was, and will remain, a source
of information and amusement for
the figure model kit builder/collector.
It's the same magazine but with
just one less word to pronounce. For
those of you who like calling it
&quot;Gluesniffers&quot; magazine, feel free.
Most of our distributors do. It's just
that in our business dealings we will
refer to it as KitBuilders Magazine.
<p>
Also in this issue we feature two
new tip articles by Joseph Jobe
(Vinyl Visions) ,and Rich Larson
(Some Assembly Required). These
guys will be picking different kits and
passing along their personal comments
<p>
We hope you enjoy the changes
we have made. Happy reading!
<p>
Enjoy!
<p>
Gordy
