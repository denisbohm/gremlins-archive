<h2>Dear Friends and Fellow Collectors,</h2>

<p>
Dimensional Designs is a company that specializes in Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy
related collectibles.
We began our business by producing our own line of latex monster masks, 3D T-shirts,
skull paperweights.
We are currently manufacturers of our own model figure kits.

<p>
Aside from our own studio projects, we do serve as an outlet for items in our specialty
from other artists and manufacturers.  We hope to bring you some very exciting, high quality
pieces of art to add to your own collection.

<p>
Recently, we have opened our doors to modelers who have sculpted their
own figures and wish to sell limited runs (in kit form).  If you are an
independent modeler or sculptor we may be interested in carrying your
figure and selling your creation through our company.  These limited
edition fan appreciation model kits are not intended to infringe
on the rights of copyright holders.  They are solely for the art of
collecting, and are sold from collector to collector on a first come
first serve basis.  They are generally made to be limited edition item.

<p>
Always keep in mind that our staff here at Dimensional Designs are
collectors as well, we understand the difficulty of finding items
to complete or begin a collection.  Many new items we purchase are not
listed.  We may have an item or information on an item you are looking
for.  So be sure to give us a call or write to us.  We are also open for
"trades", you may have an item that we are in search of.  We trade on
listed and non-listed items.
