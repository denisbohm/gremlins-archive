<h2>The art of collecting</h2>
Garage/resin model figure kits are intended for the "art of collecting" they are not created
to infringe upon copyrights, only to supply a small amount of collectors with rare pieces of
art done by the various artists available to us today.


<h2>By the way...</h2>
All model figure kits are available on a limited supply.  Sold from one collector to another,
on a first come first sold basis.  Some items will not be available once they have sold out.

<h2>Buy-Bye</h2>
Once an item is deleted, there is very little chance we will bring it back.  We hope to bring
you a new variety of original kits each time we put out a new list.  Be sure to order those
kits you are interested in now.  We can not guarantee that we will have them the next time
around.

days for a refund, credit, replacement or exchange.  (20 working days for overseas orders).
Merchandise must be in the original condition as received.  Any shipping charges incurred will
be deducted from the amount refunded and there will be a 10% restocking fee.

<h2>For orders outside of the USA</h2>
