<h2>The art of collecting</h2>
Garage/resin model figure kits are intended for the "art of collecting" they are not created
to infringe upon copyrights, only to supply a small amount of collectors with rare pieces of
art done by the various artists available to us today.


<h2>By the way...</h2>
All model figure kits are available on a limited supply.  Sold from one collector to another,
on a first come first sold basis.  Some items will not be available once they have sold out.

<h2>Buy-Bye</h2>
Once an item is deleted, there is very little chance we will bring it back.  We hope to bring
you a new variety of original kits each time we put out a new list.  Be sure to order those
kits you are interested in now.  We can not guarantee that we will have them the next time
around.

<h2>Return policy</h2>
If for any reason you are not happy with your purchase, you may return it within 10 working
days for a refund, credit, replacement or exchange.  (20 working days for overseas orders).
Merchandise must be in the original condition as received.  Any shipping charges incurred will
be deducted from the amount refunded and there will be a 10% restocking fee.

<h2>For orders outside of the USA</h2>
The shipping costs on orders shipped by air outside of the USA total about 35% of total order,
this depends on the weight and dimensions of the package.


<h2>Discounts</h2>
If you place an order for merchandise of $250.00 or more, your are entitled to a 10% discount
on your order (not to include shipping charges).

<p>
The 10% discount applies only to model kit orders.
(it does not include such specialty items such as the Crest of Dracula ring).

<p>
If you have any discount coupons, be sure to include them with your order.  Remember....
some coupons cannot be used with others.  Please read them carefully.

<h2>Attention</h2>
Due to a cease and desist order from Columbia Pictures Co., we can not sell model kits from
the following films:  7th Voyage of Sinbad, Jason and the Argonauts, The Golden Voyage of
Sinbad, Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger, and Earth vs The Flying Saucers.
We apologize for the inconvenience.  We can, however, trade from remaining stock we do have.
So if you are interested in something, telephone or fax us.  It is possible we can do a trade.

<h2>Items we are currently looking for trade</h2>

weird cool stuff, anything to do with old time magic (weird and bizarre), freak memorabilia.

coupons (when available).

<li>You can send us your address (or an address mailing label) and two .32 cents first class
