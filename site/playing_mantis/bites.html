<a href="http://faoschwarz.com"><b>FAO Schwarz</b></a>
is even getting into the kit building scene, the first kit they will carry is
<b>The Adams' Family Haunted House</b>.
This kit was produced by <b>Playing Mantis</b> and I hear that more classic Aurora kits
are in the works.  The kit is not listed on their web site, but you can reach
FAO Schwarz at 1-800-426-TOYS to order one.  It is product number 694786 and goes for $59.
They don't have it in stock yet, but it is supposed to come in before the end of October.
I asked if they would be making more Aurora kits available and they said:
&quot;Depends on how this one does sales-wise. We'd love to do them, it just
depends on if there is a market for them.&quot;
