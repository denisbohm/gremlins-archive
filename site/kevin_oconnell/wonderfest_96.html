am back from Wonderfest 1996. Anybody who went to Chiller missed a 
fantastic convention! It was much bigger and better than last year!

<p>
My adventure began when I and friends arrived friday night. We could 
not located any fellow Gremlins attendees, but did encounter many resin 
breathers who were busy stuffing bags for tomorrows festivities. I looked 
in the empty convention hall and stood amazed to discover that it was about
2 1/2 times larger than last year's exhibit hall! This year's convention was
held at the Executive West Hotel and last years was held at a Holiday 
Inn. The Executive West is a huge hotel that is decorated with a faintly
Old English flair. It has names for rooms like: Bagpipe, Scots, Sherwood,
Gaelic etc.  We tromped around the hotel floors, hoping to find a dealer
selling out of his room, but after failing to flush one, we settled into our
hotel rooms and waited for Saturday morning.

<p>
I've never encountered this before, but at Wonderfest, you can buy a 
privilege called an &quot;early bird&quot; membership. This is a convention membership
that lets you into the dealer's room before it opens officially! Yes, it 
costs about $20.00 more than the usual entrance fee!  You personally have 
to decide if it is worth to you to buy this pass. I bought one and it 
paid off- sort of. I was not into the dealers room for more than 7 minutes
when I spotted an old 1/4 Tuskuda Lum figure in it's box!  This is the 
same figure that was reissued by Tsukuda as a painted doll only this was 
the original, unassembled, model kit.  I'll be damned, just as I was 
heading to that table, this guy walks up to the table first and buys that kit
for ---$25.00----! For what ever reason, I yelled at John Weber to come over
to witness this INJUSTICE! I was just flabbergasted that I should come 
accross such a rare model, at a cheap price, only to have it bought right 
out from under my nose! I was fit to be tied!  I was not mad at the man 
at all, just the situation!  The guy just said &quot;this is the way it's done.&quot;
I soon discovered he was a dealer, purchasing from other dealers to resell
at the show, not really a fan of Lum at all, he just called it &quot;an old 
Tsukuda kit!&quot; He knew it was valuable. After asking the original dealer 
if he had any more, (he didn't) I quickly made an offer on the kit. John 
just looked at me and said &quot;I'll let you finish this deal.&quot; ( It's 
unfortunate that John and I, being good friends, are usually looking for 
the same kits. Sorry John.)  The dealer claimed it was worth $100.00 but we
settled on a lot less. I walked out of the room with the kit under my arm,
shaking from the adrenaline, and with very mixed feelings about the whole 
thing. Fate is a funny thing as you shall see, it is both kind and cruel.

<p>
My only other purchase of the convention was a 1/6 nude figure by Remix 
that vaguely looked like Sailor Mercury! Everything else was just too 
expensive to buy!! $90.00 to $220.00 for anime garage kits! Many of them 
recasts!  At noon, I entered my 1/6 Kurama, 1/8 Catty and 1/8 Pai into the
model contest. It was weird seeing them on display before the public! There
were many nice kits on display, I'll let you imagine the sight of of about
230 kits kits on display!

<p>
I attended David Fisher's panel on painting. He actually had an 
airbrush this time to demonstrate his techiniques. The two things I 
learned from this panel is that Dull Coat dries flatter if you hit it 
with a hair drier and that I probably need to thin my paint more to 
keep it from clogging my Model Master airbrush. David builds up layers of 
paint on his kits instead of trying to put the color on in a couple passes.

<p>
Saturday night I went to the Vouge Theater to see the 1933 film King Kong!
It was introduced by the convention guest of honor Ray Harryhausen who 
cited this film as one of his boyhood influences that propelled him into his
career of stop-motion animation. King Kong is one of those films you must see
on the big screen. Watching it on a TV doesn't do it justice! I was 
struck, however, by how dated the film was. Racist stereo types and 
outdated words abounded!  'Square' meant that you were trustworthy. It 
had a 'chinese cook' played by someone who was not chinese. All the 
blacks were played as savages-cowardly and cruel. The audience laughed at
most of this absurdity while patiently waiting for the true star of the show
to make his appearance. Ironically, guest Bob Burns had brought with him
the actual metal skeleton they had used to animate Kong in this film and 
it stood on the podeum during the introduction. (I'm sure Bob took 
posession of it when the lights went down)  What more can I say about 
King Kong the film? The film speaks for it's self, you'll just have to
watch it on one of those little boxes until it comes to a theater near you!

<p>
I expected Sunday to be one of those days where I would just wander around
looking at all the merchandise I had looked at the day before. I thought
I would perhaps just take some pictures and chat with the dealers.  I brought
my camera down and photographed several of the great kits that were on 
display and some that were only on display at the dealer's tables. One dealer
had some beautiful female figures inspired by Boris Vallejo(SP?) that I 
thought should have been in the artshow, but I think they may have been 
painted by Professional, David Fisher who was a judge!

<p>
As I was walking up the ailse, I saw that con guest Chris Walas was 
introducing an oriental fellow to some of the dealers. He introduced him as
Shuichi Miyawaki (I'm not 100% sure of the last name) of Kaiyodo!  I'm 
the sort of guy that gets tongue tied when I meet famous or important people.
I promptly forgot any Japanese I new and could only say that I liked 
Kaiyodo's kits, and that I wanted him to set up a booth here. (I don't 
think so kids.)  I resisted the temptation to follow him like a puppy, mostly
because my mind was blank and I didn't have any other cool dialog. He, his
fiancee Noriko and Chris Walas disappeared into the crowd. I had just met 
the man who runs Wonderfestival in Japan! What to do? I tried to be cool 
and just take some more pictures and look through the dealers tables, but 
I really wanted to meet this man again and do some serious shmoozing! I 
resolved to do this!  I had some photo's of my models, some of which, 
like Iczerone, are old Kaiyodo kits. I knew he whould get a kick out of 
seeing them.  I retrieved my photos from my hotel room and came back to 
look for him. Gone! No where to be found! I knew he was still at the 
convention, but was probably just meeting all the IMPORTANT people. I 
just decided to mingle again in the dealer's room. I was walking down an 
aisle when I spotted another oriental fellow whome I instantly suspected was
was part of &quot;the Kaiyodo group.&quot; I wanted to write a report about the 
events of Wonderfest for Gremlins, so I moved closer to get his name. 
Yukihisa.....Fujt..... Fujita Yukihisa!!!! ALARMS, BELLS and WHISTLES!	
99% of American anime fans don't know who this guy is, but I am a BIG fan of
this man's work! For those of you who get Animage magazine, look in the 
March issue at the cover of the GAINAX insert. It's signed YUKI, which is 
his pen name. Here I am, a big fan of this man, ( we are both about the 
same age, it seems strange to call him a 'man'.) and he is standing 
before me!  Before I went totally into fanboy mode, I rattled off some of 
the projects he had worked on, just to be sure I had the right guy. As 
soon as I was sure, I addressed him as Sensei and bowed very low, whether 
it was apropriate in this counrty or not. I really hope I didn't 
embarrass him, but this encounter took me so off guard that I just lost 
my cool!  He spoke only words of English and I only spoke words of Japanese.
( I will take Japanese now so I will never be this helpless again.) He did
a couple of sketches for me on a small piece of paper he had. We communicated
as best we could. All I could do was drop names and establish that I knew 
of his work.  It was an encounter of both joy and frustration. Back home 
I had photocopies of his work that I wanted to ask questions and make 
comments about, but that was a two hour drive away and I hadn't come down 
in my own car so I couldn't go back and get them.  At last I decided that 
I had communicated all that I could, so I graciously parted company and 
left him alone to enjoy the rest of the day.  I encountered him on a few 
other occasions, and they were less frantic and more fruitful. Latter in 
the day, I also met Osamu Kishikawa who works for Kodokawa Publishing. He 
spoke more English and for the life of me, I can't figure out why I 
didn't try to use him as an interpretor and talk more with YUKI.  Osamu 
is the editor of the artbooks for Shinseki Evangellion. I can't figure 
out why I didn't engage Osamu in deeper conversation about the projects 
he is working on. (Dumb, dumb, dumb!)  They were very nice people. I suppose
I was just too excited by these encounters and my brain shut down!  
Mr.Miyawaki had brought with him a built-up and painted figure of EVA-1 
that he gave to Chris Walas he also gave him a pre painted 1/4 scale 
school girl figure with red hair(very cute!) John Weber made a comment to 
Mr.Miyawaki that he liked BOME (BOAM-eh)'s(a GK sculptor)work and he gave 
John a copy of the Complete Works Of BOME!!  He gave a built up figure of the
Wonderfestival mascot ( I didn't see it) to Wonderfest V-P, Lee Stanton 
who inturn gave Mr.Miyawaki a built up figure of Nestor The Wonderfestor!
(a copy Lee said he would never sell)  As an anime figure modeler and 
anime/manga fan this encounter was one I will never forget. Fate is indeed
mysterious!

<p>
After meeting Yukihisa-san on Sunday. I spent the rest of the day kind of
aloof of the convention. Determined to enjoy the rest of the convention, 
and not just thinking about my encounter, I browsed the aisles and took 
pictures. 

<p>
One thing that I'm going to include in my camera bag next year is one 
of those collapsable monopoles with a camera mount on it. I use a telephoto
lens with a flash and holding it steady can be tricky. My photos came out 
okay, but some had feet or hands chopped off at the boarder!

<p>
I encountered a scratch built BGC Priss figure that I had seen many 
years ago at Capricon in Chicago. I had thought it was a great job then 
but seeing it again with a seasoned eye, I saw some aspects about it I 
thought were not so great. Strange what time does to your perspective.
I still think he should have put it in the artshow.  I was taking a picture
of this kit when I caught the shadow of someone about to walk in front of me.
Being hyper already, I barked an annoyed &quot;Hey!&quot; as I looked up to see who 
was going to pass between me and my subject. It was David Fisher with a 
beautiful Volks-Sorayama-Commando figure! (geez, why does this feel like 
something out of a sit-com!)  David Fisher is a cool guy so I'm sure he 
didn't take offense at my reprimand ( you have to be pretty far away with
a telephoto lens to take pictures- I should have been more carful.).  I 
took the oportunity to get a picture of him with his kit that he had painted
for the folks at Puff-N-Stuff.

<p>
Latter that day, I finally got to meet fellow modeler, Larry Brackney. It's
so hectic at the conventions that it is sometimes hard to catch up with 
people. Fortunately, John Weber saw Larry's name badge and was able to 
flag me down.  

<p>
At last, the model contest winners were announced! Larry Brackney 
walked away with several Bronze medals for his Iria, Zeiram and Guin kits.
John Weber won a bronze for his 1/8 Madoka and an Honorable mention for 
his Vampirella.  I got an honorable mention for my 1/8 Catty model, but 
because I failed to fill out the entry form completely (baka!), I wasn't 
called to the stage! (no 15 minutes of fame this time! ) The surprize winner
was a gold medal for John Tyson's 1/6 Devil Hunter Yoko kit! This kit 
definitely falls into the anime figure kit category and was judged a winner!
It was indeed a beautiful paint job; the shading on the clothes was 
especially good!

<p>
The highlight of the evening was the banquet. Guests Ray Harryhausen 
and Bob Burns gave a nice talk about Harryhausens work. We watched some 
unseen footage of Harryhausens early work, including a strange WWII 
training film he made showing jeeps and bulldosers moving by themselves
and a hut building it's self!  Ray, not being young anymore, retired for 
the evening. We then watched some home movies Bob Burns made of the sets
he built around his house to entertain trick-or-treaters on Halloween!
Bob, being associated with the movie industry, had the donated help of a 
lot of movie professionals, so these sets were very elaborate! I was most 
impressed with the Martian War Machine they crashed into the side of the
house! It had a martian that looked exactly like H.G. Wells description!
Their coup-de-gras though was a set for the Nostromo from ALIENS that went
from the driveway and into the back yard! I think it had $25,000 worth of 
materials in it, including a panel from the frist Startrek movie! They built
an Alien costume using the only known photograph of the monster at that time.
This whole affair was free to the public. I don't remember how many people
passed through Bobs yard that day, but it was in the thousands! (he had 
gotten a reputation around Halloween by that time.)  We watched some more of
Bob Burns, behind the scenes film footage which I won't go into here. It 
was wonderful way to wind down the show!

<p>
That's all for my report of Wonderfest 96.  I hope that next year, 
Wonderfest and Chiller don't clash so that more dealers can make it to 
Wonderfest, though I don't know where they would put them. All the tables 
in the dealers room were full! Wonderfest is definitely a garage-kit oriented
convention where as I've heard chiller described more as a horror-media show.
Hopefully I'll be able to make the compairison my self someday.
