   Any participant violating the good sportmanship rule will be disqualified. 
  <LI>
   All tools will be provided for you. You may have to share tools with a neighboring participant. See above...
  <LI>
   Each participant will be given a box of parts to use to build a spacecraft. You may only use items that are supplied in this box. 
  <LI>
   You will be allowed the first 5 minutes to familiarize yourself with the contents of your parts box.
  <LI> 
   You will then be given 5 minutes to trade parts from your box with other participants, if you so desire.
  <LI>
   You then have 50 minutes to build the best spaceship you can out of the materials on hand.
  <LI>
   When time is called, hands up. You're done.
  <LI>
   Participants and staff will then vote on the best spaceship design. Please do not vote for yourself.
  <LI>
   While the votes are tallied, please clean up your own mess. Your mother is not a member of the staff. :)
  <LI>
   The contest is open to any convention attendee with the following provisions:
   <UL>
   <LI>
    Members of the MIA club may not participate. You're supposed to be staffing the contest... remember... :)
   <LI>
    Adults may enter the contest, but priority will be given to participants age 17 and under. Meaning if there are any slots left over after all the children who want to join have done so, then adults may participate.
   <LI>
