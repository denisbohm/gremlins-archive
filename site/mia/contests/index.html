In accordance with our goals of promoting modeling and encouraging young modellers to build 
quality models, the MiA club is proud to announce the Junior Model Expo. The JME is a model 
show particularly aimed at younger modellers and will be judged using the MiA's open judging 
system. This will allow the participants to receive educational feedback on their entries. 
Prizes will be awarded to the top three entries and have been provided by Polar Lights and 
Colpar Hobbies. The JME will premiere at <A HREF="http://www.starland.com/">StarFest 2000</A> on April 15 
(with early registration available on Friday, April 14 as well).</P>

<P>In addition to the new JME contest, our first two contests that we held at StarCon 99 were so
 successful that we are doing them again! This time the contests will be held on April 16 at 
<A HREF="http://www.starland.com/">StarFest 2000</A> at the Holiday Inn at I70 and Chambers Rd. 
in Denver.</P>

<P>Once again we will be presenting the scratchbuild spaceship and the speed painting contests. </P>

<P>The Scratchbuild contest will allow participants to build a spaceship from miscellaneous 
parts and possibly win a Babylon 5 Starfury model for their efforts. Thanks to Coplar Hobbies 
for donating the Starfury!</P>

<P>Last time we held the speed painting contest, we used 28mm gaming miniatures and gave the 
participants a half an hour in which to give them the best paint job they could muster under 
the pressure. The winner walked away with a Geometric Figures Gowron kit! This time things are 
stepping up even more thanks to a generous donation from Geometric! Not only will the winner 
get a Geometric Worf kit, we will also be using Geometric Micro Mania kits for the contest!</P>
<BR>
Thank you Geometric!<BR>
