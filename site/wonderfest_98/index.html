<img src="../garage/letter/w.gif" alt="W">inter,
for me a time to build and paint models, lots of models
hopefully. To get some of the kits purchased off the pile and onto the
shelves. Last years "Wonderfest" and "Chiller Theatre" purchases are still
piled high in the workroom. I'll need to complete some soon because Spring
is just around the corner, which means I'll be heading to "Wonderfest"
again.
<p>
    May arrives, several kits are in mid-production, several have been
finished. I guess that leaves enough room to add some more to the ever
growing backlog. To me, this is a rite of Spring. Head south to Louisville.
Buy more kits than I can possibly finish before the next show. Also it's the
first time for me to see what all the producers have have doing all Winter.
As always, it's also the time to see what all the kitbuilders been been
doing all Winter. So "Off I go to Louisville".
<p>
    It's an 8 hour drive from Milwaukee to Louisville. Excitement keeps me
from getting a good nites sleep so I leave here at 5:30 a.m. The weather and
road conditions are great this year and I make record time, arriving at the
Executive West Hotel around 1:39 p.m. on Fri.
<p>
    Wonderfest U, is in full swing. Looks like everyone involved is having a
good time. This seems like another good idea to me. Maybe next year I'll
give it a try.
<p>
    Sat. morning, after a good breakfast in the hotel dinning room, I join
the line already formed to get into the dealers room. Much talk and
anticipation is easily felt as hundreds wait for the doors to open. The
appointed hour arrives (10:00 a.m.) and the buyers move smoothly into the
room. The crowd seems less frenzied this year, more patient. I work my way
around the room, noting things of interest and figuring what I MUST pick up
and what will be gotten at a later date. My first purchase is a Horizion
"J.P. Raptor" for $30.00, a real sweet deal.
<p>
    I spot several items to buy, several to put on my "want list" and many
more to just dream of having. The dealers are friendly and helpful. Some
tables are loaded with great buildups, some with more models than I could
ever finish. Some with items I can only wish for. I've made my plan and vow
to stick with it, so I know I won't be picking up very much, but just seeing
many of the kits makes the trip worthwhile. The contest models start to be
displayed, this is almost model sensory overload. Lots of great kits, lots
of great work done again this year. I wish the judges luck in their decision
making.
<p>
    The dealers, the contest, every where you look, you see things that stir
the imagination. I may not buy a lot this trip, I will take home lots of
good ideas and the desire to deplete the stockpile back home. I do find
several kits that I'm looking for and a few that I wasn't but like just the
same. My cup runneth over with the display of things to do, to use, to add
to the hobby. This is what Spring means to me. I may not leave Louisville
with an abundance of product, but my interest is ignited. I will leave with
a renewed interest and desire to produce more this year than last.
<p>
    Early Sun. afternoon, I load my bags, take one more trip around the
dealers room. Buy one last kit, them head for home. This Spring will remain
with me long into fall. Then I'll await next Spring, so I can journey back
tp Louisville, to experience the rites of Spring known as Wonderfest.
