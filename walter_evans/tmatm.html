<div align="left"> 
  <p>Welcome fellow modelers to my first building and painting article for Gremlins 
    in the Garage. My intention is to share ideas for building and painting garage 
    kits. I will also highlight some of the better garage kits that are currently 
    available for model users. Each article will feature or discuss lesser-known, 
    yet worthwhile model kits. In this way the article will give new light to 
    excellent models. </p>
  <p>For this installment I will be working on two finely sculpted kits by special 
    effects artist Russ Lukich. Lukich has worked on TV shows like Buffy the Vampire 
    Slayer and Angel. He is now working at the Stan Winston Studios. Russ has 
    done expert work in capturing the likeness of great 1/3-scale characters. 
    His Morlock from the Classic science fiction movie The Time Machine is revealing. 
  </p>
  <p>The other model is from the 1979 TV movie Salem’s Lot, featuring what some 
    says is one of the most terrifying vampire characters of all time, Barlow, 
    The Master. The Morlock is a one piece casting, whereas, the Master includes 
    the bust and fangs. Both busts are sculpted with intricate based which uses 
    the themes from the movies. </p>
  <p>In preparation for the kits I first washed them with hot soap and water. 
    Then premiered them with Dupli-Color scratch fill and primer. (This can be 
    picked up at most auto supply stories.) This primer works effectively on vinyl 
    and resin. I will also be painting these busts using Badgers freak flex line 
    and Com-Art. If these paints are not available, any brand of paints will work. 
  </p>

  <p align="left">The first kit I will discuss is the Master. First the base coat 
    should be Tan Flesh. Then lightly mist it with After Midnight Blue, however, 
    be sure to leave the second base coat thin enough to see through the Tan Flesh. 
    I then added highlights by mixing the base with Bleach Bone Tan. I sprayed 
    in a broken pattern over the high points of the face. At this point in the 
    process Dry Blood Red was lightly airbrushed over the sculpted veins. Dry 
    Blood Red was also applied to the mouth and eye area I then applied highlights 
    by feathering Grave Stone Gray and Tan Flesh over the bust<font color="#0066FF">.</font></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="tmatm_photo_1.gif" width="640" height="480"></p>
  <p align="center">This extra touch gives Barlow an effective "dead" look. His 
    eyes were base coated with Oozing Yellow. </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="tmatm_photo_2.gif" width="640" height="480"></p>
  <p align="center">Then misted with Dried Blood Red. This painted design created 
    a dazzling Orange color. Painting smaller circles of Oozing Acid, Cat’s Eye, 
    and Cowards Yellow over each other applied the irises. A black pupil was then 
    added to finish the eyes. I applied a coat of Bleach Bone Tan for Barlow’s 
    teeth. In order to give the teeth a worn look, Com Art’s Burnt Umber and Transparent 
    Black were painted over the teeth. This helped finish the fleshy areas.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="tmatm_photo_3.gif" width="401" height="480"></p>
  <p align="center">The Master’s robe was base coated black then highlighted with 
    Dried Blood Red. The necklace was dry-brushed Gold. Barlow’s base was base 
    coated with Road Rash Brown then highlighted Cursed Earth and Wooden Stake. 
    I then applied the same colors to his coffin but added a highlight with Grave 
    Stone Gray and a wash of Burnt Umber. The cellar door was base coated with 
    Road Rash Brown, then washed with Burnt Umber.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="tmatm_photo_4.gif" width="640" height="480"></p>
  <p align="center">When tackling the hand coming out from under the door it was 
    given a base coat of Frankenstein Flesh then washed with Transparent Black. 
    His lock on the cellar door was coated Black the Dry-brushed with Silver. 
    The stone work for the Master’s base was first base coated with Near Black, 
    then highlighted with Banshee’s Gray. Gang Green was added to ends of the 
    stones to give them a mossy look. After this design, the Master was a sight, 
    a sight for all that enjoy a good dead look to see.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="tmatm_photo_5.gif" width="640" height="480"></p>
  <p align="center">Another enticed model kit is The Morlock. The Morlock was 
    base coated with a mixture of Warlock Blue, Asphyxia Blue, and Grave Stone 
    Gray.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="tmatm_photo_6.gif" width="442" height="446"></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">The highlights were then applied by mixing the base coat with 
    Grave Stone Gray. This allowed for a more perfect highlight color. Spraying 
    Bewitched Blue into all the recesses enhanced a shadow effect.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="tmatm_photo_7.gif" width="400" height="480"></p>
  <p align="center">Warlock Blue was added to the bust to break the skin pattern 
    and allow the flesh to look more alive. In order to tie all the colors together, 
    an even lighter version of the base color was applied to the bust.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="tmatm_photo_8.gif" width="640" height="480"></p>
  <p align="center">The Morlock received a base coat of Banshee’s Gray to the 
    hair. Highlights of Pearl White and Turn Ghost White were then applied along 
    with a wash of Grave Stone Gray.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="tmatm_photo_9.gif" width="480" height="640"></p>
  <p align="center">The eyes were base coated Dried Blood red then sprayed Gold. 
    Next, the mouth area was base coated with Dried Blood Red, whereas, the teeth 
    were base coated with Bleach Bone Tan, along with a shadowed effect with Burnt 
    Umber.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="tmatm_photo_10.gif" width="640" height="480"></p>
  <p align="center">The stone areas were painted as the same as the Masters. The 
    skulls and bones in the base were coated with Bleach Bone Tan, and then they 
    were misted with Nicotine Yellow and washed with Burnt Umber. The entranceway 
    was airbrushed with Crusted Earth and Wooden Stake. The shynx head was base 
    coated with Road Rash Brown, then misted with Gold.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="tmatm_photo_11.gif" width="480" height="640"></p>
  <p align="center">Both of these kits were sealed with Testors Dull Coat and 
    the eyes and teeth with Pactra Gloss Coat. After the model kits were completed, 
    one can see how an effect can be enhanced with just a little imagination, 
    an airbrush, and some paints. These kit’s can be purchased from <a href="http://www.squidzkitz.com">Squid Kitz Studios</a>
