<p>
<font size="+2">A</font>pollo Smile scares me.
Pig tails, pink bows, ultra blond hair,
skintight white vinyl, holster and laser-pistol... she has no idea...
<i>no idea</i> what she's doing to me. Her very existence confronts me with
secret, unfulfilled desires that I thought I'd long since buried. The
low-angle shot of Wonder Woman sitting in her invisible jet; the lithe
She-Ra running alongside He-Man, on her way to wail on Skeletor; the
now defunct <i>Samuree</i> comic... all of these images and their
corresponding emotions wash over and threaten to overwhelm me.
<p>
I felt comfortable with most animated and comic-book
girls because I knew, with utmost certainty, that they did
not exist. I could deal with them, unlike their real-world
counterparts. As much as I wanted to think that I might
bump into Psylocke or Lady Death at the local deli, I was
forced (at around the age of twenty-two) to accept that
they were only figments of balding, sexually frustrated,
forty year-old men's imaginations, and nothing more. But
now, my meticulously constructed fantasy world is
crumbling around me. Here, in vivid reality, is the ultimate
geek dream girl!
<p>
As I speak to Apollo Smile, an amazing
thing happens: I find that this surreal siren is
actually a geek herself! And she knows her
stuff; from her fave show <i>Babylon 5</i> to the
anime she is so fanatical about, she speaks
with the
intensity and fervor of a hard-core. Her early influences were not
the standard girlie fare such as <i>Vogue</i>, Barbie, and Michael J. Fox,
but things I thought of as mine - comics, action-adventure TV shows,
and cartoons.

<p>
&quot;I'm a fan!&quot; she boldly proclaims. &quot;I've always gone to <i>Trek</i>
conventions and sci-fi shows, and I've always been into going to live
shows of acts and bands and performers that were a little more on
the weirder side.&quot;
<p>
When I express my surprise at hearing a girl say these things,
Ms. Smile laughs and tells me more about her youth.&quot; I got into a lot of
stuff through <i>X-Men</i>. I just loved that whole <i>Mission Impossible</i> idea
of really creative, unique people, mutants and otherwise, getting
together and specializing in their own capabilities and being a team
and working for the greater good.&quot;
<p>
These early influences are very apparent in Apollo Smile's work.
As the world's first and only Live-Action Anime girl, she has created
a whole mythos based on her favorite things. &quot;The character of
Apollo Smile is my own way of being able to express myself in the
media that I love... through music, dance, sci-fi, action cinema, female
heroism, and, of course, comics.&quot; Instead of following the old-line
mentality of creating a fantastical woman and squeezing a girl into
the suit so that she can make the rounds plugging the comic at
conventions, Apollo has done just the
opposite. She decided to create a
super-hero based on... who else, but
<i>herself</i>.
<p>
As a truly multi-media
performer, Apollo is involved in
almost every aspect of the
entertainment industry. From
music (where her 1991 self titled
debut album garnered a great
deal of critical attention) to
her <i>Apollo Smile</i> manga comic, as
well as the numerous live club
performances and appearances at
conventions and comic shops on the
East Coast, she has quickly become a cult
figure with a wide-ranging group of fans -
most of which, surprisingly enough, are <i>not</i>
guys.
<p>
Apparently, she is not the only girl interested in geekie stuff.
Recently, this boy's club of entertainment culture has been over-run
by the ladies. &quot;Over the last year, I've seen a huge growth in the girl
turnout. Chicks are really getting into the stuff.&quot; She goes on to
explain that &quot;there's a lot of girls who really want to live through the
fantasy of comic books and anime, but up until very recently it's been
perceived as such a male dominated fantasy. But I feel like it's
changing quicker now.&quot;
<p>
With her second CD in the works, along with her ongoing manga
title, Apollo Smile is working harder than ever to bring her
geek-dream to the masses, boys and girls alike.
