like only yesterday that I attended my first Chiller Halloween
Expo. Actually it's been a little over 2 years that I was introduced to
the &quot;MADNESS AT THE MEADOWLANDS&quot; and now being a card carrying member of
the meadowlands mafia, let me tell you, the ride just keeps getting better
and better! There are so many twists and turns that this show HAS to be 3
days long just so you can look at everything!! That's how much there is
to it! Over 300 dealers tables, guests galore, a costume ball with live
music, model contest and last but not least KITS!! Resin, vinyl, plastic, new,
vintage and rare kits from all over the globe! That's right the
GLOBE!! Garage kit companies from Japan, England, Canada, Sweden and all
points of the U.S.A. make the trek to Chiller! And why not. With close to
10,000 people in attendance, this is the place to be and be seen!!
<p>
I really don't know where to start,so how about with some of the
kits that caught my eye! First off Swede Creations had a Death Dealer kit
that I must have in my collection at any cost. The kit was sculpted by
Joke Lindman and is a must for any Frazetta fan!! 3D from canada's new
Namor (sub-mariner) is true to the Bill Evert version and calls out to be
displayed in any comic collector's hall of fame. Python Press amazed
everyone with their WALKING Centaur Cyclops! (THAT'S RIGHT THE THING
WALKS!!) If your into Harryhausen kits get it quick because the kit is
limited to only 12 worldwide! Alternative Images new Darkness kit and
Conan Kits are real Eye catchers! AI comes out with so many new kits each
and every show that it's hard to keep up with them! Good job guys! Needful
things new Braveheart (Mel gibson) and Nightlife Productions new Fantasy
line drew raves from guys and gals alike! One kit I MUST get (because my
wife went nuts for it) is a Fantastic Genie, ala I Dream of.... Sculpted
by Joy and Tom Snyder of Florida. If you want to get in your better
halves good graces, BUY THIS KIT!! That will keep you safe for many kits
to come. I got a chance to see the Barb Wire Kit that Dave Fisher had at
his table, great build up! Susumu Sugita and
Fewture were turning heads with kits that are now part of my ever
growing collection, namely Gullotina and Blood Hammer along with
Operation In Progress!! GEOmetric, Mental Mischief, Mad Labs, Screamin',
Resinator, Death Inc all had great kits on display.
Fairbanx Models new Madame Kwasimoto and Lily Munster sold out
before I could get my greedy paws on them! Remember this is just the tip
of the Iceberg here. You had Tom Savini at the Jayco table with their new
Fluffy kit sculpted by Tom, Wolf's Den, Fat Mike's.... Youch! This is
supposed to be a show review not a who's who of the figure kit
industry!! The magazines were on hand with Jerry Buchanan and Tom Ellis
representing
<a href="http://www.modelersresource.com"><b>The Modelers Resource</b></a>;
Gordy Dutt, Rich Larson and myself with
<a href="../kitbuilders/index.html"><b>Kitbuilders</b></a>;
Dave and Cindy Fisher along with Terry Webb from
<a href="../afm/index.html"><b>Amazing Figure Modeler</b></a>;
<a href="../chiller/index.html"><b>The Chiller Theatre</b></a>
staff; Harris Comics (Vampirella) and Ted Boghus from SPFX as
well as Scarlett Street!
<p>
Don't go yet cause it's time to introduce some of the guests that
were on hand. Like Jeff Franco, Lina Romay, Doug (Pinhead) Bradley, Russ
Meyers, Anne Francis, Candy Clark, James Hong, Tom Savini,
Yuko Moriyama who
played Iria in the live action Zeram movies, those ever popular
Scream Queens as well as those
Lovelies from Troma (Hi Tiffany) making Grown men Drool like
Teenagers, John Russo and Bill Hinzman my Zombie friends from
Night Of The Living Dead
and one of my personal Faves Sara Karloff. Had enough.. well read on!!
<p>
From what I was told the Costume Ball was a Blast with Dead
Elvis and the Screamin' Barbies Rocking the house and the costumes are
getting so wild nowadays that I can't describe them here! But Trust me
you gotta see it to believe it! The reason I wasn't at the ball was that a
small group of 23 gremlins and dealers opted for a steak dinner at a
restaurant that I frequent. Let's just say that the conversation ran the
gambit.. until the food arrived and then you could of heard a pin
drop! Plans are underway for next years dinner and I think they'll take
my reservations next time!! With everyone there wearing those wristbands
at dinner they must of thought that the asylum let us all out on weekend
passes!! Good food, great people and a fantastic show! It doesn't get any
better than this!!
<p>
Nope not done yet! Let me tell you a little about the model
contest. With over 200 kits entered this one is a hard nut to
crack! In my humble opinion it has to be one of the hardest to judge bar none!
I pity the
judges here because the fans really go the extra mile to impress and you
really have to or be lost in a sea of resin! John Bushlow from Nightlife
held his annual blank customizing contest. You know once this one catches
on the big boys are really going to sit up and take notice! This is not a
easy task to create a masterpiece out of a blank and although only about
10-12 kits were entered it was pretty tough to judge! They all looked
good to me and I was one of the judges!! All I can say is if this one
gets any bigger, John get yourself a new judge!! No way I could pick a
hands down winner (I can't even make one of those blanks look near
as good if I tried!!)
<p>
Don't worry the end is almost near!! Retailers from all over were
also on hand selling kits. Paul Antonelli's
<a href="../character_shop/index.html"><b>Character Shop</b></a> still selling
kits at Crazy Eddie Prices! Puff-n-Stuff, Kitboy, Chiller Theatre
store, Image Trading and countless more, too many to name. Listen, I can't
go on.. Let's just say that the entire resin, vinyl and styrene kit world
was here in one form or another, because I'm running out of ink and I
didn't even get to the pictures yet!
You know I had a chance to meet gremlins that I now consider good
friends, I'm dead broke from buying kits that I couldn't resist and I
hope each and every gremlin out there gets a chance to make the trip to
my stomping grounds and go broke with me at next year's April or October
show! I'll save a seat for you at the restaurant!!

<p>
Here are some pics from the latest Chiller show. Enjoy!
