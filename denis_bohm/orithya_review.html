Orithya, the Sea Nymph, is a sculpture that can appeal to everyone.
Just gazing at her gracefully swimming across the ocean floor makes
me long for a trip to the ocean.  And to grab all my kit building
supplies and have some fun building and painting this intriguing kit!
<p>
I'm a big fan of original designs and Orithya fits right in.
Eli Raphael designed this half fish and half woman character.
It's a great idea and one that I haven't seen before.  Her fish
half seems to be based on the Loin Fish, which makes for a
interesting figure.
<p>
The brown cardboard box that the kit arrives in includes a sketch of Orithya on the cover,
but it seems to be longer than the box and was partially cut off.
That's too bad as the sketch is very nice.  I would rather have
the sketch wrap around the side of the box, or have it included inside
the box (maybe rolled up or folded in half).  Each part of the kit is wrapped
in bubble wrap and foam packing material is used to keep everything
from bumping around.  The parts seemed to be very well protected.
<p>
The sculpting was performed by Edgar Perez and is very nice.  The
pose has a lot of action and grace.  The flesh is very smooth and
has nice proportions.  The hair is quite detailed and
looks like it is flowing underwater.  The ears, gills, and webbed
hands convey her underwater origins even in the human upper part
of her body.  Her lower body is very fish like and has good detail
on the scales and fins.  The arched tail also adds the the effect
that she is ready to propel herself through the water.
<p>
The base has some nice touches with coral, sponge, star fish,
and sandy areas.  Also, it appears to be the site of a sunken
ship with some wood, cannon, bones, and a skull.  It is quite an
interesting base and sets off the figure nicely.  The figure is
mounted to the base near the back of her body so that Orithya
appears to be suspended in the water.  The base also includes a
Zotz nameplate on the back.  My one complaint with the sculpting
on the base was that there were a couple of places where finger
prints could be detected.  But, since there are so many textures
on the base these are very hard to see once the base is painted.
<p>
The body was cast in a slightly brittle yellow resin.  I didn't
have any problems working with this material.  It was easy to
trim the small amount of sprue left on the parts with an x-acto
knife.  All the parts fit together well once the excess material
was removed.  There were <b>no</b> detectable seam lines anywhere.
There were a couple of medium size air holes that were easily
repaired by filling with putty.  There were also some small air
bubbles in the hair.  I didn't attempt to do anything to these
as I did not think that they would be noticeable once the hair
was painted.
<p>
The base is hollow and appears to have been made using fiberglass.
The outside bottom edge of the base is covered with a thin piece
of hard material and is very even.  The part of the rock that
supports Orithya is filled with resin for added strength.  I was
very pleasantly suprised by the casting of the base.  It is clear
that a lot of thought and energy went into developing a process
that would give great detail, light weight, high strength, and
a flat bottom surface.  More garage kit companies should pay this
much attention to their bases!
<p>
There isn't much included in the way of assembly instructions, so
you need to plan out how you want to assemble and paint the kit
yourself. Here is the approach that I suggest.  You can attach the head to the upper body first.  Then
the arms to the upper body.  Next the large fin on the back can be
attached followed by the rest of the fins on the lower body,
<b>except</b> the large fins that attach at the hips.
Then attach the upper and lower body.  The seams can be cleaned
up and puttied as you go.  This assembly order should allow you to reach all of the
seams easily.  This produces the following subassemblies: the
body, the two large fins, the coral, and the base.  The subassemblies
can then be painted individually and then attached after painting.
<p>
I'm a big fan of pinning.  There is nothing worse than seeing
a part pop off of a finished kit!  I pinned each spine on the
large fin on the back.  Then attached the fin to the back with
superglue and hit it with kicker.  I also pinned the head, arms,
and waist.  Super glue and kicker were used there also.  The smaller
fins were attached with a two part 1 minute epoxy.
<p>
The seams were fairly easy to deal with.  Where the fins join
the body I applied some fairly coarse putty and used a sculpting
tool to blend the putty into the lines on the fins.  On the neck,
arm, and waist seams I used a very fine putty, smoothed with water,
then lightly sanded after it was dry.
<p>
To get ready for painting I decided to mount some rods on the
subassemblies.  This provides a way to prime and paint the figure
without having to hold onto parts of it and possibly damage
already painted areas. I drilled a hole completely through the figure
at her hips where the large fins will be mounted and glued a long
metal rod into place.  Then I stuck the rod into a piece of wood.
I also drilled into the large fins and mounted temporary
rods.  One more rod was mounted into the bottom of the coral piece
that comes separate from the base.  At this point all of the
subassemblies can be dusted with a light coat of figure primer.
After waiting 24 hours for the primer to dry completely you will
be ready to paint.

<p>
From here the painting is up to you.  Three good reference photos
are provided with the kit.  You can also take a trip to the library
and checkout some books with pictures of Lion Fish to give you some
additional guidance if you desire.  If you want to spice up the kit
even more you might want to take a trip to a pet store and get some
fish tank goodies, like small colored rocks, to add to the base.
These could be attached after the base has been painted using some
white glue that will turn clear after curing.
<p>
In summary, I think Orithya is a great kit!  I was pleased with
the sculpting and pose and pleasantly suprised at the quality of
the base.  If you have a little experience with resin kits and
you like the pictures of this kit I recommend it.
