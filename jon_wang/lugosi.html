a huge fan of Bela Lugosi, I thought it might be interesting to chronicle all the
garage kits he has been the subject of.  When one thinks of Lugosi, the image of
his intense malevolent Dracula comes to mind - and this is basically where the
story begins.

Aurora models had the distinction of being the first to render Lugosi
in plastic with their 1962 &quot;long box&quot; edition of Dracula.  While the kit
itself does not capture a great likeness of him, the incredible box art is all Lugosi.
For any serious Lugosi fan this is a must have collectible.  The second kit to
feature  a &quot;loose&quot;  likeness of Bela was  Aurora's Dracula's Dragster.  This
caricature kit was released in 1965.  To a five year old boy this was definitely Bela
Lugosi!  Aurora did a final take on lugosi in 1971.  This was the &quot;MonsterScenes&quot; Dracula
released only in Canada.  While this is the same kit Aurora released in 1975 in the
&quot;Monsters of the Movies&quot; series, it features much better box art than its 1975
counterpart.  This kit features the classic descending stairway pose taken
from the movie.
<p>
Lugosi found his way to vinyl with Horizen's &quot;Sci-fi Art&quot; series in
1988. Sculpted by M. Kosada this was a fairly staightfoward take on dracula,
which featured a nice likeness, but overall was a bit toy like.  A good kit
nonetheless. Billiken's 1989 version of dracula was a suberb kit.  An elegant
sculpture - this still stands as the definitive Lugosi Dracula piece.
<p>
Resin from the Grave released their exellent Randy Bowen Igor in 1991
marking Lugosi's entrance into the world of resin.  This kit was sold
alone initially, then with Frankenstein and diorama base by Joe Tomasini in 1992.
<p>
Monstrology Models was the first to render a bust of Bela with a 1/6
scale study of Lugosi from &quot;The Ape Man&quot;. Sculpted by Jon Wang this piece was
offered in cold cast bronze or porcelain.
<p>
One of the big dissapoinments in garage kit modeling came when Dark
Horse failed to release Thomas kuntz' spectacular Dracula kit along with their
other classic monsters.  The recent good news is that Dark Horse plans to
finally release the kit with the Lugosi Likeness.  Rumor has it the Dracula title
will be dropped and the kit will be released as &quot;Bela Lugosi&quot;.  An interesting
and welcome twist of fate for Lugosiphiles.  Intererstingly, Kuntz had planned
to do a  Lugosi piece several years back - portraying him as an old man in his post
addiction years.   Lugosi jr, understandably, had reservations about presenting his
father in this way.  Tom, respectfully, never completed the project.
Pictures of the finished head can be seen in Artomics early catalogs.
<p>
Resin From The Grave continued the Lugosi madness with the release of
the Devil Bat kit from the movie of the same name.  This was an interesting
Lugosi piece featuring two different lugosi heads and the huge devil bat itself.
The kit was sculpted by David Grant and is perhaps his best work to date.
<p>
At least two super deformed kits have been done in Bela's honor.  Mad Labs
Bela Drac kit and Dimensional Designs Bela the Vampire by Randy Lambert.
Both are exellent and worth checking out even if you're not particularly
tickled by super deformeds.
<p>
With nearly 10 kits in his honor Lugosi must be viewed as one of the most
popular horror subjects.  Fortunately, more Lugosi kits are planned including
Janus Companies eagerly awaited White Zombie piece by Tom Kuntz as well a
life size bust by Cine Art - the same company that recently sculted an
outstanding Karloff Frankenstein.
<p>
If I've overlooked any Lugosi kits please
<a href="mailto:Docmuscle9@aol.com"><font size="+1">let us know</font></a> what you've
got.  Let's fill in the time line and get pictures of all the kits.
<p>
One final thought - Lugosi Lives!
